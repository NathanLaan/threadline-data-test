But if you did, perhaps you noticed Ring&#8217;s Orwellian &#8220;Search Party&#8221; spot &#8212; the company was hoping to get customers excited about a new feature that allows them to upload a picture of their missing pet and have Ring cameras all over the neighborhood search for a visual match.

Many were left wondering just who or what the new system would be searching for when it wasn&#8217;t busy sniffing out lost pups.</p>\n<p>The folks at Wyze were quick to capitalize on the misstep, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROFblZ_-9q4\" target=\"_blank\">releasing their own parody ad</a> a few days later that showed various three-letter agencies leaving rave reviews for the new feature. By Thursday, Ring announced they would be <a href=\"https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/ring-and-flock-cancel-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\">canceling a planned expansion</a> that would have given the divisive Flock Safety access to their network of cameras. We&#8217;re sure it was just a coincidence.</p>\n<p>Speaking of three-letter agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency has announced this week that they will <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/president-trump-and-administrator-zeldin-deliver-single-largest-deregulatory-action-us\" target=\"_blank\">no longer incentivize the inclusion of stop-start systems</a> on new automobiles. The feature, which shuts off the engine when the vehicle comes to a stop, was never actually required by federal law; rather, the EPA previously awarded credits to automakers that added the feature, which would help them meet overall emission standards. Manufacturers are free to continue offering stop-start systems on their cars if they wish, but without the EPA credits, there&#8217;s little benefit in doing so. Especially since, as <em>Car and Driver</em> notes, it seems like <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a70350799/epa-eliminating-stop-start-automaker-comments/\" target=\"_blank\">most manufacturers are happy to be rid of it</a>. The feature has long been controversial with drivers as well, to the point that we&#8217;ve seen <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2022/05/18/defeat-your-cars-autostop-feature-with-a-little-switchbot/\">DIY methods to shut it off</a>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-916504\"></span></p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/02/14/havana-syndrome-cia-norway-experiment/\" target=\"_blank\">incredible story ran in <em>The Washington Post</em> yesterday</a> (<a href=\"https://archive.is/nzo7W\" target=\"_blank\">free to read archive</a>) that&#8217;s so wild that it&#8217;s almost hard to believe. In fact, if it wasn&#8217;t from <em>The Washington Post</em>, we&#8217;d be sure it was some kind of conspiracy theory fanfic. The short version goes like this: a Norwegian researcher who was so confident the &#8220;<a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2017/09/25/cuban-embassy-attacks-and-the-microwave-auditory-effect/\">Havana syndrome</a>&#8221; wasn&#8217;t the result of a directed energy weapon decided to prove it by not only building some sort of pulsed RF device based on leaked classified documents, but  fired the thing at himself as a test. We&#8217;re not sure what the Norwegian equivalent to the &#8220;Shocked Pikachu Face&#8221; meme is, but we&#8217;ll give you one guess as to what happened.</p>\n<p>If that wasn&#8217;t crazy enough, the article goes on to casually mention that the US Department of Homeland Security secretly purchased a similar pulsed-energy weapon for several million dollars on the black market during the Biden administration, and is currently studying it. Despite it apparently containing Russian components, the Feds have yet to determine who actually built the thing. You&#8217;ll have a hard time finding a bigger proponent for the free exchange of information than Hackaday, but even we have to admit&#8230;maybe there are <em>some</em> things it&#8217;s better we don&#8217;t know about.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_916576\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-916576\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/links-21526_tower.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"916576\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2026/02/15/hackaday-links-february-15-2026/links-21526_tower/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/links-21526_tower.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"624,411\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"links-21526_tower\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Perfect for Meshtastic&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/links-21526_tower.jpg?w=400\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/links-21526_tower.jpg?w=624\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-916576\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/links-21526_tower.jpg?w=400\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/links-21526_tower.jpg 624w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/links-21526_tower.jpg?resize=250,165 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/links-21526_tower.jpg?resize=400,263 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-916576\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Perfect for Meshtastic</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Of course, if you&#8217;re looking to really maximize the effects of your black market pulsed-energy weapon, you&#8217;ll need to get it up high (maybe, what the hell do we know). Or perhaps you&#8217;re just a radio enthusiast. In either event, if you&#8217;re within driving distance of Tennessee, you&#8217;ll want to keep an eye on this <a href=\"https://www.govdeals.com/en/asset/355/1319\" target=\"_blank\">government auction for an 80-foot-tall mobile communications tower</a>. According to the listing posted by the Madisonville Police Department, the towable rig was built in 2016, weighs in at a little over 10,000 pounds, and has been kept in storage. It just needs some air in the tires to get it moving again.</p>\n<p>As of this writing, the high bid is just $565, but with 18 days left to go on the auction, we suspect that number will be considerably higher when the gavel drops. We&#8217;ll check back next month to see what it sold for, and on the off-chance that any of you actually buy it, <em>please</em> let us know.</p>\n<p>If all this talk of mass surveillance and shady government dealings has you down, perhaps a quick game of <a href=\"https://mrdoob.github.io/three-descent/\" target=\"_blank\">web-based <em>Descent</em></a> will lighten the mood. It&#8217;s the product of a <a href=\"https://github.com/mrdoob/three-descent\" target=\"_blank\">port to Three.js by [mrdoob]</a>, completed with the aid of Claude. We know many of you are critical of AI-produced code, and not without good reason, but the results in this case are pretty slick.</p>\n<p>Finally, we&#8217;ll go out on a limb and guess that more than a few in the audience are fans of the film <em>Short Circuit</em>, which turns 40 years old this year. In celebration, <a href=\"https://www.shortcircuit40.com/\" target=\"_blank\">an event is being planned for June</a> in Astoria, Oregon, where parts of the movie were filmed. As if you needed any other reason to meet Steve Guttenberg, you&#8217;ll also get the chance to pose for pictures with Johnny 5 and sit in on Q&amp;A discussions with the cast and crew. There&#8217;s even going to be licensed merch for sale, which we can only hope means you&#8217;ll be able to buy one of those miniature J5&#8217;s from <em>Short Circuit 2</em>. It&#8217;s not the sort of event Hackaday generally covers, but we&#8217;re certainly tempted.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"SHORT CIRCUIT (1986) 40TH ANNIVERSARY | OFFICIAL EVENT PROMO | JOHNNY 5 IS ALIVE!\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BO3KBwCXS-0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<hr />\n<p>See something interesting that you think would be a good fit for our weekly Links column? <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/submit-a-tip/\">Drop us a line</a>, we&#8217;d love to hear about it.</p>\n",

This also mostly depended on what home computer you could get your hands on, which was a market that &#8212; at least in Japan &#8212; Nintendo was very happy to slide into with their &#8216;Nintendo Family Computer&#8217;, or &#8216;Famicom&#8217; for short. With the available peripherals, including a tape deck and keyboard, you could actually create a fairly decent home computer, as demonstrated by [Throaty Mumbo] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGMEF-zbh_k\" target=\"_blank\">in a recent video</a>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-916366\"></span></p>\n<p>After a lengthy unboxing of the new-in-box components, we move on to the highlight of the show, the HVC-007 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_BASIC\" target=\"_blank\">Family BASIC</a> package, which includes a cartridge and <a href=\"https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Family_BASIC_Keyboard\" target=\"_blank\">the keyboard</a>. The latter of these connects to the Famicom&#8217;s expansion port. Inside the package, you also find a big Family BASIC manual that includes sprites and code to copy. Of course, everything is in Japanese, so [Throaty] had to wrestle his way through the translations.</p>\n<p>The cassette tape is used to save applications, with the BASIC package also including a tape with the Sample 3 application, which is used in the video to demonstrate loading software from tape on the Famicom. Although [Throaty] unfortunately didn&#8217;t sit down to type over the code for the sample listings in the manual, it does provide an interesting glimpse at the all-Nintendo family computer that the rest of the world never got to enjoy.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Attempting to Code a Game on the Nintendo Famicom\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oGMEF-zbh_k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n",

A local government or water utility will employ a water tower or pumping facility to ensure that there&#8217;s always water available to every home and business connected to it, all day, every day, and at a relatively constant pressure. This isn&#8217;t true the world over, though, and in [Sameer]&#8217;s home of Rajasthan he has to deal with a particularly onerous problem with the local water supply. Although he is connected to a utility, there is only water available at certain times of day, and not on a reliable schedule or at a particularly high pressure. This causes all kinds of problems, <a href=\"https://bababuilds.com/blog/esp32-smart-water-meter-diy/\" target=\"_blank\">but he was able to employ an ESP32 to solve some of the headaches</a>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-916480\"></span></p>\n<p>Most of [Sameer]&#8217;s neighbors install small pumps on the water main to pull water into reservoirs when it&#8217;s available. This creates two major problems, the first of which is that with all these pumps running, they can sometimes pull a vacuum on the water main, which can draw in contaminants and cause cavitation in the pumps. The second is that, if these pumps are on a timer and run when there&#8217;s no water available, they can damage themselves. [Sameer]&#8217;s solution pairs a flow sensor with a pump that is controllable via an automation tool like Home Assistant. He also includes a hydraulic analysis of this particular situation, such as placing the sensor on the output side of the pump rather than the inlet, as well as making sure that there is a laminar flow of water in the pipe it is installed on to ensure that it is taking valid measurements.</p>\n<p>With everything set up and running, the water pump can automatically detect if there is water available, pump it to the reservoir as long as it lasts, and then automatically turn off the pump to avoid any thermal damage from running dry. [Sameer] even includes a complete Home Assistant setup for those who would like to replicate his work. We also think that this has utility outside of household water supplies as well, perhaps <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2010/03/27/automated-rain-barrel-watering-system/\">those watering their gardens with stored rainwater</a> or those <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2024/12/15/rainwater-from-the-road-to-the-garden/\">using other unique, semi-automated water catchment systems</a>.</p>\n",

Rather than a quick poke under the hood to rebuild a carburetor and adjust the engine timing by hand, you&#8217;ll be pulling out a scan tool to gain access to the computer and figure out why the darn thing won&#8217;t start <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biS8vC-13uE\" target=\"_blank\">after someone else used a scan tool on it</a>, as happened to [DiagnoseDan].</p>\n<p>The question was whether the third-party scan tool that was used by the owner had done something to the software settings that would prevent the engine of this 2012 Renault Megane RS from starting, such as erasing keys, or if it was something more subtle. With no stored fault codes and the engine having healthy fuel, spark, and cam sensor readings, the conclusion was that the ECU was not doing its fuel injector things for some reason.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the root cause was that the ECU had been modded, with a re-mapping performed in 2020, meaning that the scan tool that [Dan] was using couldn&#8217;t properly interact with the ECU. Reflashing the ECU with the original manufacturer&#8217;s firmware was thus the next step, which is pretty involved in itself.</p>\n<p>Reinstalling the OS on the car proved to be the solution. Likely, the modded firmware had stored some fault codes, as the ECU normally doesn&#8217;t start the engine if there are active codes stored. The third-party scan tool was thus likely blameless, but the inability to just clear fault codes was the real issue.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-916137\"></span></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Destroyed by Aftermarket Scantool ?!

So why not bring the magical nostalgia of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfM-JLqdszg\" target=\"_blank\">GameCube controller to the Switch series of consoles</a>?</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t [Dorison Hugo&#8217;s] <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2018/03/16/gamecube-dock-for-switch-mods-nintendo-with-more-nintendo/\">first attempt at building a Switch dock,</a> but with seven years of development, there are a lot of updates in the project to unpack. One version allows the user to play on the Switch&#8217;s screen instead of on a docked display, and another comes with a mechanical lock to prevent the console from being stolen. But what really caught our eye is the modifications made to the OEM Switch docks.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, there is enough space inside a Switch dock to stuff in four GameCube ports. Short of spinning a custom board, the trick was picking the right commercial adapter to start with. The Wii U branded adapter [Dorison] was using wouldn&#8217;t fit. However, a rather small third-party adapter from Input Integrity got the job done. Space was still rather tight, and the ports needed to be removed from the board to fit. Some cables with simple connectors on the GameCube connector side make cable management a bit simpler later. Holes have to be very neatly cut into the front of the Switch dock to complete the look, with the mods held in with some superglue, epoxy, and hot glue.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the completion of the dock, the Switch 2 was released, so naturally, that dock went through a similar process. While there is more internal space for cable management on this iteration of the console, there is too little space for the ports to fit without modification. Shaving off a few millimeters from the top of the ports allows them to fit inside the case, but makes cutting professional-looking holes in the front panel all the more challenging. Unfortunately, there is no good way to connect the adapter&#8217;s USB cable to the dock&#8217;s PCB, so an extra USB cable became necessary.</p>\n<p>Regardless of any imperfections, both modified docks look excellent, with near-OEM quality!</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-916225\"></span></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Switch Docks we Deserve\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NfM-JLqdszg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

The answer? Of course, you connect it to <a href=\"https://github.com/jim11662418/ESP8266_WiFi_Analog_Clock\" target=\"_blank\">NTP and synchronize the clock with an atomic time source</a>. If you are familiar with how these generic quartz clock movements work, you can probably guess the first step is to gut the movement, leaving only the drive motor.</p>\n<p>The motor is somewhat like a stepper motor. The ESP8266 processor can easily control the clock hands by sending pulses to the motor. The rest is simple network access and control. If the network time is ahead, the CPU gooses the clock a little. If it is behind, the CPU stalls the clock until it catches up.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-915769\"></span></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever done a project like this, you know there is one major problem. At some point, the processor needs to know where the hands are now. On initial setup, you can force the issue. However, if the power goes out, it won&#8217;t work well. If the power goes out at, say, 8 AM and turns back on at 9 AM, the CPU will be happy to correct the time to agree with the NTP time. The problem is that the processor has no idea that the hands started at 8 AM, so the time will be off.</p>\n<p>To combat this problem, the design uses an EERAM chip to store the current time. In the event of a power failure, the CPU knows where its hands are and can adjust accordingly.</p>\n<p>While you usually use these movements to keep time, once you can control them, you can do <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2025/03/09/clock-mechanism-goes-crazy-for-arduino/\">any crazy thing you like</a>. Or, even <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2025/12/08/trace-line-clock-does-it-with-magnets/\">anything as artistic</a> as you can dream up.</p>\n",

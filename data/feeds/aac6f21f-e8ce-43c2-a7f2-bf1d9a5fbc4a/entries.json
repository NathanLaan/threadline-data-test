Fields for username and password, 'Sign in with Face ID' option, and 'Forgot ID/P' link. A 'Face ID' icon overlay in the center.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><br>\n</figure>\n<p>Through no fault of Apple, Face ID is having a moment — and not in a good way.</p>\n<p>Sure, the biometric security feature works as well as it ever does, using a face scan to unlock your iPhone, confirm mobile payments and generally an extra layer of protection between your digital data and the prying eyes of the outside world.</p>\n<p>But we live in a time of increasing unrest, and with it comes a concern about biometric security features in general. Run afoul of what purports to be law-and-order these days, and your own face can be used against you by police who can compel you to use Face ID unlocking against your will. A security writer at PC Mag goes so far as to suggest <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/why-you-should-stop-using-face-id-right-now\">you should stop using Face ID entirely</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m not sure I want to take that drastic a step with my own iPhone. While concerns about biometric locks are certainly valid, I find Face ID pretty convenient to use when I’m out and about and my phone remains firmly in my possession. Glancing at my iPhone to unlock is certainly quicker than tapping out a passcode every time, and I like using Face ID to lock down everything from health data in my health care provider’s app to images I’ve got stashed in separate Photos folders.</p>\n<p>That said, when I attend a protest (and it seems like I’m showing up at a lot of those lately), I do disable Face ID before heading out. The protests I’m attending haven’t ever gotten out of hand, but better safe than sorry, I reckon. While there’s not much stopping law enforcement from making you use your face or thumbprint to unlock a device, you aren’t <a href=\"https://legalclarity.org/do-you-have-to-give-police-your-phone-password/\">compelled to share your passcode</a> if you’re detained.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/change-face-id-and-attention-settings-iph646624222/ios\">Turning off Face ID</a> requires you to dive into the Settings app, tapping the Face ID &amp; Passcode menu and then entering in that passcode when prompted. Only then can you toggle off the feature. And while that’s simple enough to do, it’s not a feature you can turn off discreetly or quickly should you remember that Face ID is enabled as someone’s approaching you with ill intent.</p>\n<p>There’s a shortcut of sorts: Just press and hold the side button on the right side of your iPhone at the same time you press and hold the volume-up button. iPhone veterans will recognize this as the button combo that brings up the Slide to Power Off command, which is exactly what will happen. As a neat bonus feature, you’ll even get some haptic feedback to let you know that the Slide to Power Off screen has appeared, allowing you to discreetly pull off this manuever without even looking at your phone. (You can also tap the sleep/wake button five times.)</p>\n<p>“But I just want to shut down Face ID, not power off my iPhone,” you may be saying. And my friend, shutting down Face ID is exactly what you’ve just done.</p>\n<p>Tap the Cancel button on the Slide to Power Off Screen, and you’ll bring up your phone’s lock screen. Only now, the only way to unlock your iPhone is to enter a passcode. Face ID remains disabled until the next time you unlock your phone, giving you some measure of protection from having the Face ID feature used against you.</p>\n<h2>Apple should do more</h2>\n<p>As a workaround, the Slide to Power Off move will do in a pinch. But I’d like there to be an even easier way to turn off Face ID, whether that’s through a Shortcut or with the help of Siri.</p>\n<p>Poking around the built-in Shortcuts app on the iPhone, you can find pre-populated controls for silencing your phone, adjusting connectivity or the iPhone’s display, and more. But if there’s a way to quickly access the Face ID &amp; Passcode menu in the Settings app, I couldn’t find it. (You <em>can</em> use Shortcuts’s Open URL action and the URL pattern <code>prefs:root=PASSCODE</code> to <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/ios/a-comprehensive-guide-to-all-120-settings-urls-supported-by-ios-and-ipados-13-1/\">create an action that opens it</a>, but you’ll still need to enter your password and flip the switch manually.) Likewise, there’s no tappable shortcut in the Control Center, which would seem like a natural place for a quick on-screen way to turn off Face ID. (You could even put the shortcut right there on the lock screen now that we’re firmly living in the brave new world of iOS customization.)</p>\n<p>Likewise, Siri is no help when it comes to handling Face ID management. In the current version of iOS 26, a simple “Turn off Face ID command” will have Siri apologetically telling you that it doesn’t understand what you’re talking about. Perhaps that could be some of the smarts Siri is supposed to pick up in a coming update to iOS 26.</p>\n<p>And really, this is the sort of thing Apple should add. The company makes the privacy features of its products a central part of the case for why you should buy Apple, with most of the recent TV spots focusing on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jom8zBix-4c\">keeping your browsing data private</a>. But I would contend an even bigger privacy concern would be having everything that’s stored on your iPhone—text messages, emails, photos—made available on command to a some mask-wearing federal agent just because you’re using a biometric feature as intended.</p>\n<p>The central role that phones play in our lives coupled with uncertain times at home and abroad have people rethinking how they should approach Face ID. Apple needs to be doing the same.</p>\n",

One officer looks at a device, saying, 'There's gotta be a way to recover lost footage.' A 'FOX' logo is visible.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><br>\n</figure>\n<p>Sometimes I can’t help myself.</p>\n<p>The other day, while watching an episode of “Animal Control”<sup id=\"fnref-38470-animal\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38470-animal\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup>, I realized that I have been writing about technology so long that I can’t even turn off my brain to stop from shouting troubleshooting advice at the made-up people on my TV during a half-hour of light comedy.</p>\n<p>Here’s the scenario: Our hero, Seattle Animal Control Office Frank Shaw (expertly played by Joel McHale), has been roped into ferrying around his arch-nemesis, a Cesar Millan-esque dog whisperer played by guest star Ken Jeong. (Kudos to you if you immediately picked up on this mini-“Community” reunion.) Joel McHale’s character has recorded a video on his phone of Ken Jeong having an encounter with an aggressive dog that will cause the latter no small amount of professional and personal embarrassment.</p>\n<p>Ken Jeong manages to guilt Joel McHale into deleting the video from his phone by spinning a sob story that (if you know the kinds of characters Ken Jeong plays) is completely made up. But Joel McHale falls for it and deletes the video, only to have Ken Jeong turn the tables and cause McHale no small amount of professional and personal embarrassment. Joel McHale is left to fume about his missed opportunity.</p>\n<p>“There’s gotta be a way to recover lost footage,” he says, while impotently turning his phone’s flashlight on.</p>\n<p>And where other people might chuckle at this little interlude, a person in my position finds himself shouting at the screen, “There is! There is, you big galoot!” as if Joel McHale is going to answer back.</p>\n<p>We do not have to guess as to what phone Joel McHale’s character is using — it is very clearly an iPhone. Given the camera array that I spotted when reviewing the footage with the same frame-by-frame intensity that JFK conspiracy theorists study the Zapruder film, I’d suggest that it’s an iPhone 16 Pro, but that’s neither here nor there. The point is, Frank is using a recent iPhone, so we’ll assume the on-board software is relatively up-to-date.</p>\n<p>Everybody who’s used any piece of tech for any length of time knows that nothing’s truly deleted — at least not right away. In the case of photos and videos that you remove from your iPhone, by default they sit in a folder for 30 days before they disappear completely.</p>\n<p>In the case of this particular “Animal Control” episode, all Frank would have to do to get that damning video back would be to fire up the Photos app on his iPhone, tap on the Collections tab and find the Recently Deleted folder tucked away in the Utilities section. Frank would tap on the deleted video, select Recover, and sit back and smile while that nasty Ken Jeong finally gets what’s coming to him.</p>\n<p>Near as I can tell, there’s no way to disable the Recently Deleted folder feature so that deleted photos and videos go directly to that big trash can in the sky, nor is there a way to extend the stay of execution beyond those 30 days.</p>\n<p>Frank could also avoid these kind of situations altogether by backing up his photos and videos to a third-party cloud service. (iCloud wouldn’t work in this case, as deleting things off your phone removes them from Apple’s syncing service.) But considering his tendency to repeatedly turn on his iPhone’s flashlight, that might be a backup best practice beyond his skill set.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-38470-animal\">\nIt’s a fun little workplace comedy—it’s not going to reinvent the genre or anything, but it’s a pleasant enough way to spend half an hour each week, and if you need a laugh or two these days, “Animal Control” is worth checking out. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-38470-animal\" title=\"Return to main content.\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

You need iOS 14.5/iPadOS 14.5 or later. The iPhone 11 and later added Precision Finding via an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio; it’s not available for any iPad. An Apple Watch requires watchOS 8 or later, on an Apple Watch Series 3 or later (2017). Macs gained Find My item access with macOS 12 Monterey in 2021, which sweeps in Macs mostly released in 2015, though a few older models qualify, too.<sup id=\"fnref-38448-pair\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38448-pair\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>This revised AirTag 2 thus breaks backwards compatibility in three ways, with one twist.</p>\n<p>First, some older devices can’t see newer AirTags.

These models were released between 2018 and 2020.</li>\n<li>An Apple Watch has to be a Series 6 or later (2020), Ultra or later (2022), or SE 2 or later (2022) to install watchOS 26.</li>\n<li>Tahoe requires that a Mac has an M-series chip or is one of a handful of late Intel models from 2019 and 2020.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Second, people who have chosen not to update older devices compatible with the “26” releases can’t use the new AirTag.</p>\n<p>Third, the twist: Because there’s no explicit labeling, it will be very difficult to tell the original and revised AirTag apart. <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/26/how-to-tell-the-difference-between-airtag-2-and-the-original-airtag/\">9to5Mac published an article</a> on this very topic, noting:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  If it’s an AirTag 1, the back will say: AirTag / Designed by Apple in California / Assembled in China / Bluetooth LE / Ultra Wideband.<br>\n  If it’s an AirTag 2, the back will say: AirTag / FIND MY / NFC / BLUETOOTH LE / ULTRA WIDEBAND / IP67 / APPLE INC.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If there was ever a time for product naming and physical feature distinguishing, maybe this was it? Perhaps the AirTag 2 should have been matte black or space gray.</p>\n<h2>For further reading</h2>\n<p>Why do I know so much (apparently) about AirTags?

      "content": "<p>The Verge’s Terrence O’Brien details <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/874134/spotify-page-match-audiobook-sync\">Spotify’s solution for helping you jump between audio and print books</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Point your camera at a page, and the Spotify app uses computer vision to match text with audio. If you have to jump behind the wheel for a long drive, but didn’t want to put down The Buffalo Hunter Hunter, you can just snap a pic to jump to the spot in the audiobook where you left off in the physical book.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It works in reverse too, apparently. Point your camera at your physical book and it’ll tell you whether to flip back or forth to reach the spot you left off in your audiobook. (Spotify also today announced that it will partner with Bookshop.org to sell physical copies of its audiobooks.)</p>\n<p>It’s a clever workaround, and has me wondering if a similar system could provide a workaround for the lack of sync on other hardware, like the <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2026/01/if-the-future-of-e-readers-is-getting-weird-im-here-for-it/\">Xteink X4</a>.</p>\n<p><em>That said</em>, it does not escape me that this particular workaround is something that we end up with largely because of the imposition of Digital Rights Management on ebooks. In an ideal world, you’d simply be able to pick up any device—audio, ebook, etc.—and just keep reading where you left off.</p>\n<p>While I don’t expect the current situation to change anytime soon, there are occasional glimmers of hope. Amazon, for example, now lets <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/kindle-launches-drm-free-ebooks\">customers download DRM-free ebooks</a> (when publishers have made them available).</p>\n<p>I’ve <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157617/apple-ebooks-amazon-drm-libby.html\">argued before that Apple pushing for a world of DRM-free ebooks</a>—the same way it once did for music—could make the company more relevant in the market once again. But it’s done vanishingly little with its ebook marketplace in recent years, and nothing on the horizon suggests anything different to come.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/874134/spotify-page-match-audiobook-sync\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2026/02/spotify-comes-up-with-a-clever-way-to-sync-audio-and-print-books/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sling1daypass-6c.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Smartphone displaying 'Sling 1 DAY PASS' on a football.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"></figure>\n<p>I cut the cable TV cord just about seven years ago, and I don’t regret the move at all. Through a judicious selection of streaming services—some free, some bundled—I’m able to see most of what I care to. And for the most part, it’s all on my own schedule.</p>\n<p>The one pain point has been sports, which remains one of the few things keeping cable TV afloat. Even that’s changing a little bit, as streaming services are picking up coverage of more events. But to have access to everything, I’d have to subscribe to a whole host of packages, and that balloons the cost up to what I was paying for cable way back when. No thank you.</p>\n<p>But there’s a solution of sorts when I need a sports fix, especially if there’s a can’t-miss event that I want to watch from the comfort of my own couch instead of at a sports bar or a friend’s house. It’s day passes via Sling’s streaming service.</p>\n<p>If you’re not aware, Sling bundles up a bunch of different channels into one of two collections—Orange or Blue—that you can either buy separately or as one. It costs $45/month to buy one or the other or $69 for the whole megillah. That’s a bit steep for my tastes, but last August, Sling introduced a day pass option, where you can pay just $5 for 24-hour’s worth of access to the bundle of your choice.</p>\n<p>So in this scenario, if there’s some event I want to watch on ESPN, I fire up the Sling app on my Apple TV, select the event from the schedule and follow the prompts to hand over my $5. (There’s a little extra tacked on for taxes, but the total bill is less than $6.) And that day pass means I don’t just get to watch one event on ESPN—for the next 24 hours I can watch <em>anything</em> on Sling’s Orange tier, which includes channels like the Food Network, TNT, TBS, and more.</p>\n<p>I can tell you that Sling day passes work great in practice. I have a New Year’s Day tradition of watching the Rose Bowl game, a by-product of spending some formative years in Southern California. Or at least I <em>had</em> that tradition: the Rose Bowl has moved from free-to-air TV over to cable in recent years, blocking the game from my cord-cutting view.</p>\n<p>On <em>this</em> New Year’s Day, though, I bought a Sling day pass, specifically to watch the Rose Bowl game. And because I made my purchase early enough in the day, I also got to watch two additional football games that were airing on ESPN. It was a nice throwback to my cable TV days, only without the big monthly bill.</p>\n<p>There are, however, a couple pitfalls to the day pass approach. First, once you make a purchase from Sling, you’ll never be lonely again, as the streaming service will send many entreaties to your mailbox urging you to maybe consider a full monthly subscription. A quick tap of the Unsubscribe button takes care of that problem, though.</p>\n<p>A more pertinent issue would be the fact that those day passes can add up pretty quickly if you don’t exercise some restraint. Fortunately, that’s not a problem for me, as my New Year’s Day splurge happened when there was an event I wanted to see at a time when I planned to be home. Maybe there will be similar circumstances later in the year—a World Cup match, maybe, or an NCAA tournament game. But I’m not too worried about racking up day pass charges.</p>\n<p>And even there, you’ve got options. In addition to its day passes, Sling also has 3-day ($10) and weekly ($15) options, which can come in handy if there’s a multi-day sporting event on the calendar. I imagine those will get a workout in some corners when March Madness rolls around.</p>\n<p>Cord cutting remains tough if you’re a sports fan, particularly if you blanch at the idea of committing to multiple streaming services just to watch your favorite teams. But at least Sling’s day passes give you a little more flexibility when it comes to unwinding with a good game.</p>\n",

Instead of cramming phone features relayed through your iPhone into FaceTime, you can use a full-fledged Phone app. I have been a big fan of it, since I spend most of my working hours standing in front of a desktop Mac. I far prefer using my hard-wired USB headset for calls than AirPods or, gasp, holding my iPhone to my ear!<sup id=\"fnref-38382-speaker\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38382-speaker\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>After months of using the Phone app successfuly, I suddenly couldn’t get audio input to work. The Phone app has minimal controls and—I thought—no option to select audio input or output, which, in other apps, means the system selection rules apply.</p>\n<p>I use several <a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/\">Rogue Amoeba</a> apps and installed the latest version of <a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/\">SoundSource</a> to see if that helped. Maybe there was an audio routing problem?

(He’s also a technology writer, so we trade off troubleshooting.) After trying several things, I launched FaceTime by clicking the camera icon on the Phone lozenge that appears by default in the upper-right corner of your display during a call.</p>\n<p>Jeff still couldn’t hear me! Interesting. FaceTime’s input and output controls are ancient and mysterious. Audio and video are both controlled from the (inappropriately named) Video menu, and it turned out that my audio input was set to a screen-sharing program I no longer use. I changed it to the microphone that was set as my system default, and suddenly my voice rang out.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/facetime-menu-rotated-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of audio and video settings menu\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>The ridiculous FaceTime Video menu, which contains audio settings for FaceTime and Phone (undocumented), is so long I’m showing it sideways.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>“Ah ha!” I thought to myself—and said to Jeff and to editor Jason Snell—”I am a very clever chap and should document this as an article for Six Colors,” which Jason agreed to. In editing the article, Jason said, “Isn’t there a Video menu in the Phone app?” Despite my recollection that there was none, and my recent checking for such a menu, there it was on my Mac. It must have been there all along, and, <em>Westworld</em>-like, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibQydeS0IHw\">it didn’t look like anything to me</a>.</p>\n<p>In my defense: Why, why, is there a Video menu in an app called Phone that doesn’t use video?<sup id=\"fnref-38382-proviso\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38382-proviso\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">3</a></sup> Apple doesn’t document this in the Phone part of its Tahoe manual And I wasn’t the only one unaware of it: Jason and Jeff didn’t know it existed either, until Jason was pushed past the <a href=\"https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Somebody_Else%27s_Problem_Field\">Somebody Else’s Problem Field</a> level of awareness.</p>\n<p>I guess this is how I keep humble.

Apple and Google Maps can provide similar information about how and when to catch a bus or a train, but Transit has always focused more tightly on those modes, with lots of real-time data, and a social component, if you’re into that sort of thing.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/atBART-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Smartphone screenshot of an app showing routes to San Francisco International Airport.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Tap on a route you’re interested in to see how long you’ll need to wait for the next bus or train.

You can also select your destination stop, and use the Go button to plot your trip. </figcaption></figure>\n<p>It had been a long time since I’ve used Transit, so updates haven’t been on my radar until I found myself in Northern California recently. I needed to use BART, the AC Transit bus system, and San Francisco’s MUNI, all in the course of a weeklong trip. And when I opened Transit, I discovered that a lot of things about using the app have gotten better <a href=\"https://blog.transitapp.com/six-o/\">with the release of version 6.0 last year</a>.</p>\n<p>Transit has always been best as a “live” app, the kind you want by your side when you need to know if you’ve missed the bus, or how long it will be before the next one comes. It works great for route-planning, too, but so do the “big two” mapping apps. Transit also excels when you’re on a train or bus, watching for a stop.</p>\n<p>What’s new are the big, bright boxes that tell you how long you need to wait for your transit vehicle, offered with real-time data, when available. It’s also easier to scroll a list of stops your vehicle will make, because the list is bigger and bolder onscreen. As before, you can use the Go feature to plot your route, live, and have Transit tell you where and when to get off, with any combination of phone and Apple Watch notifications.</p>\n<p>If you’re planning a trip, Transit offers a lot of preferences you can adjust, whether it’s limiting the amount of walking you need to do, or getting there quickly, whatever the mix of modes. These have been beefed up, but they’re a little hard to find for the beginner.</p>\n<p>There’s always been a social component to Transit, from usage badges to aggregated data that gives the app more information about the routes its users frequent. In the most recent version, there are also poll questions, meant to gather information about vehicles, stops and safety. Multiple choice questions pop up when you’re on a bus or train, and it’s easy to either ignore them or participate. If you answer two or three multiple-choice questions, Transit will ask if it can send you more, or if you’d rather not. It might be annoying to some riders, but it’s a way to pass the time while you ride, and the questions are all on the app’s screen, not pushed to your phone as notifications… Which feels like a nice balance.</p>\n",

Apple Pay is for point-of-sale (POS) transactions at a payment terminal or the like, as well as for payments in apps or in Safari. AutoFill Cards, the name of the menu items, lets you, er, automatically fill cards within Safari, and in any browser that supports Apple’s autofill framework.</p>\n<p>Why does Apple have two places to store credit and debit cards? Why is the way you set them up similar, but not identical? When can you use one and not the other?</p>\n<p>I thought I knew the full answer prior to researching my new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/wallet/?pt=6COLORS\">Take Control of Wallet</a></em>, but it took a lot of careful reading and testing to understand what I had been missing.</p>\n<p>(Yes, I wrote an entire book about Wallet. You may laugh! But Take Control Books publisher Joe Kissell and I agreed on it after I realized how many pain points I kept finding as an ostensibly experienced user. Wallet has a lot of unexplored territory for many people—including me!)</p>\n\n<h2>Pick a card, any card, to enter</h2>\n<p>As far as I can tell, you could start entering and syncing payment cards within Safari as of 2013, with the release of Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks and iOS 7 (which encompassed iPad at that point). Apple added secure password synchronization via iCloud Keychain in those releases, including support for debit and credit card numbers.</p>\n<p>An autofill card entry requires you to enter a card number and all associated details.<sup id=\"fnref-38113-security\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38113-security\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup> You can start on a Mac at Safari: Settings: AutoFill, and click the Edit button next to “Credit cards” (it also includes debit cards). On an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, you can also go to Settings/System Settings: Wallet &amp; Apple Pay: AutoFill Cards. The iPhone and iPad let you bypass manual entry by pointing your camera at a card, and visible details are extracted and dropped into the form for you.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/autofill-safari-mac-bordered.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of AutoFill Settings in Safari\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>AutoFill in Safari handles several cases, including credit cards (and debit cards).</figcaption></figure>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/autofill-cards-mac-sbs.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of Wallet settings on a Mac: left, a list of AutoFill Cards; right, blank entry for manually filling\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>AutoFill Cards contain the identical information as on a physical card.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>You will note that when you go to that particular location on any device, Apple prompts you for some kind of authentication. That’s because you’ve stored card information that could be extracted and used by someone else simply by looking at it—the details are exactly what would be entered in a Web form.</p>\n<p>Visiting a payment site in Safari on any Apple platform, you can tap or click in most payment card form fields, and Safari provides a list of cards that you can drop in. Autofilling requires authentication. On other browsers that support autofill in macOS, you typically have to Control-click/right-click in a field, then choose AutoFill: Credit Card, authenticate, and then use a long scrolling pop-up menu to fill in or copy information.</p>\n<p>But note that at the bottom of AutoFill Cards, there’s an option labeled Apple Pay Compatibility: if enabled, either before or after you have entered cards, your device checks whether a given card or cards support Apple Pay’s contactless method. If so, you’re prompted to add the card or cards to Apple Pay. (One advantage of AutoFill Cards is that you can include payment cards here that aren’t supported by Apple Pay, which can include some store-brand cards and stored-value cards.)</p>\n<p>Now, we know Apple Pay uses a different process, one that doesn’t send the actual card number, and which involves some encrypted handshaking with merchants, banks, or card-processing networks. So why are we storing cards for autofill, too? And what exactly is the difference?</p>\n<p>Let me introduce you to the Secure Element.</p>\n<h2>Keeping card numbers in a special lockbox</h2>\n<p>I confess I had never heard of the Secure Element before. Or, perhaps having seen the name, I confused it with the <em><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/web\">Secure Enclave</a></em>, Apple’s proprietary security component that handles private information and security keys.</p>\n<p>The Secure Enclave is built largely around material entering and not leaving, or generating cryptographic elements internally. For instance, when you enroll in Face ID or Touch ID, the data collected is passed to the Secure Enclave and not stored in regular memory or on a drive. When you later authenticate, biometric details are sent to the Secure Enclave for verification, and it responds. The Secure Enclave is built into the T2 Security Chip for later Intel Macs and is part of the system-on-a-chip (SoC) of M-series Macs.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-M3-chip-series-architecture-231030.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Photos of circuitry of M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>There is so little information about the Secure Element, all I can do is show you some chips (the M3 series) and note that somewhere on each of them, probably right next to Waldo, is the Secure Element.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In contrast, the Secure Element allows <em>two-way</em> communication, though not with Apple or your device! When you add a card to Apple Pay by entering the details or using a card’s RFID chip, the card number is passed to the Secure Element and never stored by Apple. The Secure Element negotiates a secure connection with the card issuer or its payment network, and you’re asked to validate possession in one of several ways, like entering the security code or a texted confirmation number.</p>\n<p>Once validated, the card network passes back a cryptographic element used as part of future transactions and a <em>device-specific card number</em> (called a Device Account Number or DAN).<sup id=\"fnref-38113-max\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38113-max\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">2</a></sup> This number does not correspond to your physical card’s number. It’s stored within the Secure Element. Card networks also mark the number so it can’t be used for in-person swipe transactions, on websites when entered manually, or when read to a merchant over the phone. This number can only be deployed via the Secure Element with a secret that only it possesses, unique to the DAN and device.</p>\n<p>Apple has no access to this number; only the “applets” that run on the Secure Element do. The last four digits of the number are passed back to the operating system so they can be displayed in Wallet, but the rest of the number remains secret.<sup id=\"fnref-38113-four\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38113-four\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>(With Apple Card and Apple Cash, Apple creates this number with the Secure Element during card setup. Apple provides access to a virtual card number via Wallet for iPhone or Apple Watch for manual or autofill transactions, which is a substitute for a physical card number, and you can see it in full.)</p>\n<p>When you use Apple Pay at a payment terminal over NFC (near field communication) via an iPhone or Apple Watch, the Secure Element creates a cryptographically secured transaction with the DAN and a unique security code, which passes directly over NFC between the terminal and the chip. Only the card issuer or network can decrypt that transaction.</p>\n<p>When you use Apple Pay via Safari, a third-party browser (by scanning a 2D code), or within an app, Apple requires all the parties involved—like the website and charging merchant—to have completed steps with Apple or payment networks. The transactions are wrapped in more complicated layers with verification codes and encryption that are as secure as an in-person NFC payment.</p>\n<p>All right! Now you know about the Secure Element and this unique handoff that Apple engages in. But why don’t Apple Pay and AutoFill Cards share information?</p>\n<h2>Pay as you go</h2>\n<p>Here’s the crux, as you will have seen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Pay cards don’t sync across devices.</li>\n<li>AutoFill Cards <em>do</em>, so long as you have Settings/Systems Settings: <em>account name</em>: iCloud: See All: Wallet enabled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now you know the reason: Apple Pay cards must be enrolled on each device, because there’s a process of creating a device-specific number for the card that can only be accomplished with biometric or other authentication on the device. AutoFill Cards are identical across all devices, so protected by iCloud security and device-based authentication when you want to view them or fill them into a browser form.</p>\n<p>However, there is a time-saver for adding Apple Pay cards that I’m not sure everyone is aware of. In Wallet for iPhone or Apple Watch, you can tap the Add button (iPhone) or More…: Add Card (Apple Watch), and choose Cards Found For You. You can also tap Add Card in Settings/System in Settings on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. (The Mac shows these cards initially, as “Select cards to use with Apple Pay.”)</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cards-found-sbs.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of Wallet offering additional cards found on other devices to add to Apple Pay (left, list of cards; right, adding one of them).\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Apple Pay can’t sync, but it can import enough information from your other devices to let you proceed to a verification stage to add a card.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If Apple Pay can’t sync, why do these entries appear? Apple Pay can’t sync payment cards for use, but it can sync just enough information about a card that you can select it on another device and use the bank, issuer, or network’s verification process to complete adding it to Apple Pay, since—I would guess—you’ve previously proved your ownership on another device. It’s not perfect, but it still achieves the necessary goal of creating a Secure Element entry.</p>\n<h2>For further reading</h2>\n<p>If you found this useful or enlightening, please take a look at my new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/wallet/?pt=6COLORS\">Take Control of Wallet</a></em>.

(Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For the past decade and change, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/author/philip-michaels\">I’ve tested and reviewed a large number of Android phones</a>, augmenting the iPhone expertise I’ve built up since seeing the very first iPhone live and in person at Macworld Expo 2007. And while that parade of phones has included some winning devices, my overall impression of the Android experience falls somewhere along the lines of “How do people live like this?”</p>\n<p>That’s largely a reflection of the haphazard way Android phones receive their software updates. Some, like Google’s own Pixel devices, get new features right away, while others see updates once phone makers and wireless carriers are good and ready to release them. As someone used to downloading iOS updates the moment they’re available, that throws me. Android partisans tell me I’m being silly — sometimes politely, sometimes less so — and they may well have a point.</p>\n<p>But even if some elements of the Android experience don’t land with me, I’d have to be a pretty narrow-minded person not to appreciate the features that <em>do</em> deliver. Android phones get a lot of things right — and some of those are missing in action when it comes to the iPhone.</p>\n<p>Look, <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/10/charts-apple-caps-off-best-fiscal-year-with-q4-record/\">Apple didn’t sell more than $201 billion in iPhones during its 2024 fiscal year</a> by listening to my advice, and I certainly don’t expect the company to start casting sideways glances toward Android phone makers to surreptitiously gather ideas on how to spruce up the next iPhones. But I do think there’s some merit in looking at areas where Android phones excel and how adopting something similar might give the iPhone a boost.</p>\n<p>After all, we have some evidence that this already happens to some degree. Google added a rather distinctive horizontal camera bar to the Pixel 6 back in 2021. And while I don’t think the iPhone 17 Pro’s extended camera array is a direct copy, it certainly seems to draw some inspiration from what the Pixel has offered for years. Bringing the new look to the iPhone also allowed Apple to shift around internal components so that the current iPhone can benefit from a bigger battery and a vapor chamber, so there are benefits to adopting, adapting and improving.</p>\n<p>So here’s what I’d flag up from my time looking at Android phones for features I’d like to see on the iPhone.</p>\n\n<h2>More photo and video capture tools</h2>\n<p>One of the best rivalries going right now involves Apple and Google battling it out to see whose phones can produce the best photos. It’s a pretty even match-up that seems to shift every time one of the companies rolls out a new flagship device, but I do think Google’s use of computational photography to produce high-quality images gives it an edge over Apple.</p>\n<p>Some of this involves long-standing capabilities like the Super Res Zoom feature that’s been a part of Pixel phones for years. It cleans up digital zooms so that they don’t have the noise and fuzziness that can creep into a shot the closer you zoom in. I’ve also been impressed by features like <a href=\"https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/photos/how-google-photos-best-take-works/\">Best Take</a>, where the Pixel uses multiple exposures in group shots to make sure everyone’s looking their best.</p>\n<p>I’d especially like to see Apple try its hand at a version of Pixel camera features, such as Add Me or Camera Coach. <a href=\"https://pixel.withgoogle.com/Pixel_9_Pro/use-add-me-to-take-group-photos?hl=en&amp;country=US\">Add Me</a>, debuting with 2024’s Pixel 9 release, lets you insert yourself into group photos you take, using AR overlays to show you where to stand and then stitching together the photos by tapping into AI. My results with Add Me on Pixel phones tended to be hit-or-miss — often, the final output depends heavily on who you hand the camera phone off to — but I bet Apple could make the process a little bit more foolproof.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Pixel 10’s <a href=\"https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/devices/pixel/how-to-use-camera-coach/\">Camera Coach</a> feature isn’t flawless. But I like the concept behind it, as Camera Coach uses the phone’s Gemini assistant to make real-time suggestions on how to take a better shot. Once Apple gets its act together with Siri — and more on that in a bit — this is something the iPhone could easily offer.</p>\n<h2>A Pixel Screenshots-style app for the iPhone</h2>\n<p>I take a lot of screenshots on my phone — sometimes to preserve information I want to remember, sometimes to chronicle how-to steps for an article. And when I use a Pixel phone, I like that there’s an app that lets me stay on top of those screenshots, rather than letting them live unsorted on my camera roll.</p>\n<p>I’m speaking of the <a href=\"https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/devices/pixel/google-pixel-screenshots-tips/\">Pixel Screenshots app</a>, introduced with the Pixel 9, that collects all the screenshots you’ve captured. But it also lets you do more than that, like set reminders if there’s a specific action you want to take that’s related to that screenshot (even if it’s something as basic as “remind me to enter this recipe I’ve found into my database of recipes when I have more time.”) You can group screenshots into collections, too — handy for keeping those how-to screenshots in one place.</p>\n<p>My favorite part of the Screenshots app is that those screenshots are now searchable — as in, the Pixel’s on-board smarts allow you to search for screenshots based on the information they contain. It saves me the trouble of having to remember when I captured a particular screenshot by just bringing up what I’m looking for, when I want it.</p>\n<p>I feel like Apple is taking steps in this direction by expanding Visual Intelligence in iOS 26 to work with screenshots — adding calendar entries based on times and dates in a screenshot, translating words in a screenshot and running web searches on objects included in a screenshot. Cataloging the contents of those screenshots in a single app feels like the next natural step in Visual Intelligence’s evolution.</p>\n<h2>A smarter Siri that works across apps</h2>\n<p>I don’t have to tell you that Siri needs to get a lot smarter, a lot faster. But if you’ve had a chance to use the Gemini Assistant on any recent Android flagship, you know how far behind Apple is when it comes to a truly intelligent assistant.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, the <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2026/01/gurman-details-apple-two-phase-ai-rollout/\">iOS 26.4 update and its rumored updates to Siri</a> will get Apple back in the game, though I don’t think it would be reasonable to expect Apple to catch up with Android with just one software update. If Apple is truly serious about making a go of Apple Intelligence and its suite of AI tools, it would be wise to work toward what Samsung currently offers with its <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/lb/support/mobile-devices/what-is-cross-app-action-feature/\">cross-app actions through Galaxy AI</a>.</p>\n<p>Samsung introduced cross-app actions just about a year ago, and they really show off what on-device AI can offer, even to an AI skeptic like myself. With this feature, you can issue one command to your on-device assistant — “find me a nearby BBQ joint and text the address to my good pal Jason,” for example — and your assistant carries out that task across multiple apps. There’s no need for repeated commands or clarifications — just tell the assistant what you want done, and it goes and carries out the multi-step task.</p>\n<p>Outside of some of the camera features mentioned above, this is probably the Android capability I miss the most when I’m back in my familiar iPhone terrain. And it’s something Apple needs to adapt on its own sooner rather than later.</p>\n",

Today the company <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/xcode-26-point-3-unlocks-the-power-of-agentic-coding/\">announced the latest update to its Xcode developer tool</a>, which brings support for agentic AI coding.</p>\n<p>Adding the agentic model opens up features like the ability for these AI models to get even deeper access to and more power with your projects. For example, the agents can look at  and parse your project’s file structure to get more information, or even test and build the project all by itself. They’ll also have access to the latest documentation, allowing them to take advantage of the most recent APIs. Perhaps most impressively, these tools continue to iterate, repeatedly testing, verifying, and fixing errors until the project builds successfully.</p>\n<p>This feature builds on top of the existing intelligence-powered tools and integrations that Apple introduced in Xcode 26 last year. Out of the box, Xcode 26.3 has built-in support for Claude Agent and ChatGPT’s Codex, allowing users to log in with their accounts or API tokens. But because this system is underpinned by Model Context Protocol (MCP), any other agent that supports the open standard can be integrated as well.</p>\n<p>Xcode 26.3’s release candidate is available for download today.</p>\n",

Not directly, anyway. And it’s not just an iOS or iPadOS limitation—macOS won’t let you do it either.</p>\n<p>I can understand why Mihir asks. An image in RAW format can occupy several times the amount of storage as a JPEG equivalent. This has to do with the nature of the image being stored, as I explain below.</p>\n<p>There are good reasons to capture as RAW and good reasons to discard those formats later. I’ll go through the background of RAW, and then provide a workaround to Apple’s missing piece.</p>\n<h2>Pre-post-processed camera sensor data</h2>\n<p>The RAW format used by digital cameras is often capitalized as RAW, but it’s not an acronym, nor is it a format in the traditional sense.</p>\n<p>RAW means the file contains “raw,” or unprocessed, sensor data from your camera. To produce a JPEG, TIFF, or other format, a digital camera—including your iPhone—performs post-processing to produce an image that’s immediately usable. This can involve making significant changes to dynamic range and white balance, or even combining multiple images as a form of computational photography, as Apple does with iPhone photos.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/jpeg-plus-raw-in-photos-1280.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of image of lake and mountains in Photos with an overlay of the Info panel show it is a RAW plus JPEG file\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>RAW+JPEG is a common way to get a high-resolution processed version and the editable original sensor data in a single package in Photos.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This makes RAW the digital equivalent of a film negative: it’s typically larger than a post-processed file, and contains information that hasn’t yet been shaved down or squeezed into a presentable output. This gives you more flexibility when editing, but it requires processing to be usable for design, printing, or sharing.</p>\n<p>Many cameras let you set a RAW export that includes a JPEG preview usable on its own. The JPEG is the best post-processed output from the RAW, and was originally provided because desktop (and later mobile) software didn’t support RAW or didn’t always keep up to date. Without the JPEG, importing the RAW file by itself would have been much less useful.</p>\n<p>There’s no single RAW standard—Canon, Nikon, Sony, and others each have their own proprietary versions. It has become common to write “raw” in all caps, probably to distinguish it from the adjective form.</p>\n<p>Because the information comes more or less directly from sensors without intermediate steps, it contains much more data that appears like noise, as the variation between adjacent sensors is retained rather than smoothed away. So even for RAW formats that compress data—not all do—the files will be larger than final images intended for viewing or printing. RAW will always be much larger than a corresponding JPEG file, as JPEG is <em>lossy</em> by nature, and discards some information even when you’re using the maximum quality setting.</p>\n<p>After camera makers began supplying RAW output, often requiring apps they released to support it, photo-management and image-editing tools added RAW processing filters to meet the needs of digital photographers. Every professional app supports importing RAW, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Pixelmator Pro, Capture One, and DxO PhotoLab. And Photos!</p>\n<p>Image-editing apps generally treat RAW as an import format: you view a preview, then apply changes before it is imported into an editing environment where you can work on the resulting image. Photo-management apps with built-in editing tools, like Photos and Lightroom, typically retain the original RAW image, and allow you to apply modifications on top. This provides much more flexibility in achieving your desired outcome.</p>\n<h2>One image unit, indivisible</h2>\n<p>When you import RAW+JPEG pairs into Photos, Apple treats them as a single, indivisible unit. You can choose which version to use as the basis for editing (Image: Use RAW as Original or Use JPEG as Original), but you cannot discard one half of the pair while keeping the other. Delete the image, and both files are thrown away.</p>\n<p>Apple built Photos around a <em>lossless workflow</em>. This means that the original file that’s imported isn’t modified—changes are layered on top and previewed, and can be reverted back to the source image. You’d think it might engineer an override in a case like this, but apparently not.</p>\n<p>If you need to reclaim the storage space those RAW files occupy, it’s only possible on a Mac, and it requires exporting, deleting, and re-importing.</p>\n<p>Follow these steps if you haven’t made any modifications that you want to keep for any or all of your RAW+JPEG pairs:</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/export-as-original-xmp-selected-bordered.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of Export as Unmodified Original dialgo with Export IPTC as XMP checked.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Make sure to check Export IPTC as XMP to create a sidebar file with metadata you’ve added to an image.</figcaption></figure>\n<ol>\n<li>Select the images you want to retain in JPEG format.</li>\n<li>Choose File: Export: Export Unmodified Originals. In the export dialog, enable IPTC as XMP—this creates a sidecar file containing your metadata (titles, keywords, locations, descriptions, etc.). Without that, you’ll lose any metadata you added.</li>\n<li>Choose a destination and click Export.</li>\n<li>In the resulting folder, each RAW+JPEG file is represented by three files: the RAW file, the JPEG image, and an XMP sidecar.</li>\n<li>Delete the RAW file or files from that folder.<sup id=\"fnref-38228-rawext\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38228-rawext\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup> (If you don’t, Photos treats the two as a pair and merges them when re-importing.)</li>\n<li>Back in Photos, delete the original RAW+JPEG pairs. These are moved to the Recently Deleted album (see below).</li>\n<li>Reimport the folder containing just the JPEG and XMP sidecar. Photos will apply metadata from the sidecar file automatically.</li>\n<li>Delete the folder to free up space.</li>\n</ol>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/finder-raw-jpeg-folder-bordered.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of Finder folder with a mix of JPEG, XMP, and RAW files.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>The export files are split into three parts. You discard the RAW files before re-importing.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Of course, you can use the same process to jettison the JPEG and retain the RAW-formatted file.</p>\n<p>When you delete files, if you’re sure that you have all the backups you need, you can click the Recently Deleted album in the Photos sidebar, authenticate if prompted, and click Delete All. (Or select images and click Delete <em>X</em> Items.) This removes the images from your Mac, iCloud Photos, and all linked devices immediately and forever. Use wisely!</p>\n<p>Now, I noted above that this works for images that you haven’t modified in Photos. As part of its lossless workflow, exporting unmodified originals means you lose any changes unless you follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Before step 5 above, return to each modified image in Photos. </li>\n<li>The re-imported JPEG image should appear next to the RAW+JPEG file, because of the timestamp, which is preserved from the XMP data. Select the RAW+JPEG file, and press Command-Shift-C (Image: Copy Edits).

The holiday quarters are always Apple’s biggest, and this was no exception. It offered the most revenue ($143.8B) and most iPhone revenue ($85.3B) of any financial quarter in Apple’s history.</p>\n<p>Suffice it to say that the iPhone 17 family is a hit.</p>\n<p>“This is the strongest iPhone lineup we’ve ever had, and by far the most popular,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said during his <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2026/01/this-is-tim-complete-transcript-of-apples-q1-2026-financial-call/\">conference call with analysts</a>. As for the quarter itself? “It exceeded our expectations, to say the least.” Spoken like a man whose most popular product, the one vital to his company’s existence, grew 23% from the year-ago quarter.</p>\n<p>Even more interesting, though, is Apple’s suggestion that it’s still selling the iPhone 17 about as fast as it can make them—or to be more specific, about as fast as TSMC can make cutting-edge 3nm chips to power them, per Cook:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We exited the December quarter with very lean channel inventory due to that staggering level of demand, and based on that, we’re in a supply chase mode to meet the very high levels of customer demand. We are currently constrained, and at this point, it’s difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance. The constraints that we have are driven by the availability of the advanced nodes that our SOCs are produced on, and at this time, we’re seeing less flexibility in the supply chain than normal, partly because of our increased demand that I just spoke about.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Those details are really interesting. Back during the height of the pandemic, sales were constrained because Apple lacked access to “legacy nodes”—chips made on older processes for stuff like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. That is definitely not the case now, when it’s the “advanced nodes” of 3nm chips at TSMC that are just not being built fast enough because demand was much higher than Apple expected.</p>\n<p>This also extends a long-standing story that the Chinese market <em>really</em> likes a new-looking iPhone. Overall, Apple’s revenue was up 38% in China. Cook said that traffic in Chinese Apple Stores grew by “strong double digits,” and cited surveys that said the iPad was the top-selling tablet in urban China and the MacBook Air and Mac mini were the top-selling laptop and desktop in the last quarter in urban China. Cook, a longtime proponent of Apple’s business in China, seems thrilled.</p>\n<h2>Department of the Tough Compare</h2>\n<p>Mac revenue was down 7% in the quarter, the poorest performance of all Apple’s categories. But it’s hard to be that down about the results, because not only did the Mac still generate $8.4B in revenue and reach an all-time high in its overall installed base, but this was all happening in a quarter that is the proverbial “tough compare”—since Apple released the M4 MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac in the year-ago quarter, and only the low-end M5 MacBook Pro in this quarter.</p>\n<p>Full credit to analyst Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs for the most creative way possible of trying to get Apple to reveal its future product strategies: Ng asked Apple CFO Kevan Parekh if there would be any tough comparisons due in the upcoming quarter, to which Parekh replied, “There’s nothing that rises to that kind of color that we’d outline in the outlook.”</p>\n<p>Let me translate this for you: Ng is wondering if, perhaps, Apple is going to release some nice new Macs this quarter that will mean that it’s not a “tough compare” versus Q2 of 2025. Parekh replied by essentially pointing at his previous statement and saying that the dog did not, in fact, bark.</p>\n<p>Look, we know there will be new MacBook Pros eventually, and probably pretty soon. Maybe they’ll help with Q2 Mac sales, though at this point they’d only be able to contribute for about half of the quarter. Still, a gold star to Ng for trying to logic his way into getting Parekh to reveal things about future product releases.</p>\n<h2>The storm clouds of financial headwinds… are called off</h2>\n<p>Apple posted a company gross margin of 48.2%, based on a 40.7% products margin and an astounding 76.5% margin on services. This was actually above the high end of Apple’s previous guidance on margin. This fact left several analysts on the call flabbergasted, none more so than Ben Reitzes of Mellius:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  You know, I’m pretty shocked. I got to hand it to you, Tim, that you’re able to do 48% to 49%. What’s really going on there? How are you doing that with… the [memory] prices?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Parekh’s answer was basically that Apple tended to sell more of its high-margin products than its lower-margin ones during the quarter, which pushed margin up. What <em>really</em> impressed the analysts was his insistence that even this upcoming quarter, where memory price issues are expected to become even more serious, Apple says it feels “pretty good” about its guidance to another 48% to 49% margin quarter.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rev-projection-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"another chart\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"></figure>\n<p>Looking more broadly at Apple’s forecast, the company says the second quarter should offer 13% to 16% growth versus the year-ago quarter. Considering that the Q2 2025 revenue number was $95.4B, this means Apple expects to generate somewhere between $108B and $111B in revenue next quarter. That’s just a staggering number, because it suggests that even Apple’s <em>boring</em> quarters are going to routinely generate more than $100B in revenue. (For the record, last year’s fourth quarter was the first non-holiday quarter with more than $100B in Apple revenue. This would be the second. There may be no going back.)</p>\n<h2>Odds and ends</h2>\n<p>A few other notes about the numbers and call before I wrap it up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The iPad, bolstered by the A16 base iPad and the M5 iPad Pro, was up 6%.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wearables was down 2%, marking 10 straight quarters of year-over-year decline. (I suspect the softness in this category is why Apple is reportedly planning on launching several new home-based products, including a screen-based controller and a security camera.) However, here’s an interesting tidbit: Apple said it couldn’t make AirPods Pro 3 fast enough to meet demand, and that it believes the category would have grown had it not been for that supply constraint.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Forget profits and revenues. “This quarter set an all-time record for operating cash flow, coming in at $53.9 billion,” Parekh reported. Accounting nerds, this is your stand up and cheer moment. The cash must flow!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Everyone</em> wants to know more about Apple’s AI deal with Google, but Apple’s not talking. “We aren’t going to provide any details on our arrangement and collaboration with Google,” Parekh said. Cook emphasized that it should be thought of “as a collaboration,” rather than Google just riding in and saving Apple’s bacon. When Ben Reitzes of Mellius tried to get more out of Cook, only to be stonewalled, he replied: “Bummer. Okay, I tried,” he said. “You did,” the CEO replied through a squall of laughter.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

There are some amazing moments in “Top Dogs,” mostly when you’re watching a dog and their handler close up, or when you’re in the arena in Birmingham, England, watching the dog show. Unfortunately, there are also a bunch of pretty shaky moments: distracting quick cuts, some vertigo-generating dramatic camera moves, and a reliance (albeit understandable) on non-immersive footage in order to make the narrative make sense despite the lack of the right immersive camera angle.</p>\n<p>The more I watch immersive content, the more I realize that it requires patience to help immerse you in the scene. “Top Dogs” lacks patience, even when it pads the main dog-show narrative with side quests to Flyball and agility competitions. I found myself wanting to watch Flyball or agility for a while, just to understand how it worked, but the documentary isn’t really interested in lingering on anything.</p>\n<p>So, does “Top Dogs” have some fun fluffy dog action? Yes! I enjoyed watching some remarkable speciments of various dog breeds, even if there was not a single Boxer in sight.

This is Six Colors’s transcript of the call for January 29, 2026.</p>\n\n<h2>Tim Cook’s opening statement</h2>\n<p>Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. I am proud to say that we just had a quarter for the record books. We are reporting our best ever quarter, with $143.8 billion in revenue, up 16% from a year ago and exceeding our expectations. The demand for iPhone was simply staggering, with revenue growing 23% year-over-year and all-time records across every geographic segment.</p>\n<p>Services set an all-time revenue record as well, up 14% from a year ago, and EPS reached an all-time record of $2.84, growing a robust 19% year-over-year. We set all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific, and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. We continued to gain momentum in emerging markets, which includes India, where we saw strong double-digit revenue growth. Greater China also grew 38% year-over-year, driven by iPhone, which had record upgraders and double-digit growth on switchers.</p>\n<p>Apple’s December quarter results underscore our relentless commitment to innovation, to our customers, and to our mission to build the best products and services in the world. Now I’d like to take a closer look at results from across our lineup, beginning with iPhone.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, it was a fantastic quarter for iPhone, with an all-time revenue record of $85.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year. This is the strongest iPhone lineup we’ve ever had, and by far the most popular. Throughout the quarter, customer enthusiasm for iPhone was simply extraordinary. Users were incredibly excited about everything [it] enables them to do. iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max deliver the ultimate iPhone experience. They feature the best-ever performance and battery life on an iPhone, the most advanced camera system, and a striking design. iPhone Air, our slimmest and lightest smartphone yet, packs powerful capabilities into an ultra-slim and sleek design. An iPhone 17 is a truly fantastic upgrade at an incredible value.</p>\n<p>Turning to Mac, revenue was $8.4 billion for the December quarter. We were pleased to see the Mac install base reach another all-time high, with nearly half of customers who purchased a Mac being new to the product. The M5-powered 14-inch MacBook Pro takes a huge leap in AI performance thanks to the next-generation GPU architecture and a faster Neural Engine. From the world’s most popular laptop for consumers and businesses in MacBook Air to the small and spectacular Mac Mini, every Mac in our lineup has something special to offer users and with the recently released Apple Creator Studio—available across Mac, iPad and iPhone—creators have more tools at their fingertips to make incredible music or turn their devices into a video production studio.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, iPad saw December quarter revenue of $8.6 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with an all-time record for upgraders. We are proud to have our strongest lineup ever, from iPad powered by A16, which is proving to be incredibly popular; to iPad Air, with its amazing versatility; to the unbelievably powerful M5 iPad Pro, with its remarkably thin and light design. It’s no wonder that iPad continued to be the most popular tablet in the world.</p>\n<p>Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $11.5 billion. With Apple Watch Ultra 3 and Apple Watch Series 11, users are tapping into a comprehensive set of health and wellness features to help them meet their health goals. In a recent survey, we see an increasing number of users telling us they’re wearing their watch to sleep, which allows them to check their sleep scores each morning and find ways to improve their sleep quality. And Apple Watch alerts are enabling important conversations between users and their doctors regarding potential signs of hypertension. These are just some of the many ways that Watch is helping people live healthier lives.</p>\n<p>The response to AirPods Pro 3 has been amazing. Customers are raving about the rich, immersive sound quality, the unmatched level of active noise cancellation, and the noticeably improved comfort that makes them effortless to wear. Features like live translation are also changing the way people can communicate by helping users connect across languages in real time and making everyday conversations feel more natural and accessible. Together these innovations create an experience that feels both powerful and personal, and the enthusiasm we are seeing reflects just how strongly AirPods Pro 3 are resonating with customers.</p>\n<p>Across our product categories, we are seeing very high levels of customer satisfaction, and we are proud to report that we have a new record for our installed base, with more than 2.5 billion active devices. During the quarter, we were excited to see that the majority of users on enabled iPhones are actively leveraging the power of Apple Intelligence. Since the launch of Apple Intelligence, we’ve introduced dozens of features, including Writing Tools and Clean Up, and made it available in 15 languages. These AI experiences are personal, private, integrated across our platforms, and relevant to what our users do every day. We are bringing intelligence to more of what people already love about our products, so we can make every experience even more capable and effortless.</p>\n<p>One of our most popular features is Visual Intelligence, which helps users learn and do more than ever with the content on their iPhone screen, making it faster to search, take action, and answer questions across their apps. And as I touched on earlier, we are hearing powerful stories of people using live translation to communicate seamlessly across languages.</p>\n<p>And these are just some of the many powerful AI features that are enabling our users to do remarkable things with our products, which are far and away the best platforms in the world for AI. That’s in no small part because of the extraordinary power and performance of Apple silicon. Building on our efforts in the AI space, we are also collaborating with Google to develop the next generation of Apple Foundation Models. This will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year. We’re incredibly excited for what’s to come with so many new experiences to unlock.</p>\n<p>Turning to Services, we achieved an all-time revenue record of $30 billion, 14% higher from a year ago. Services also set all-time revenue records in both developed and emerging markets. Apple TV has seen fantastic momentum, with December seeing a 36% increase in viewership over the previous year. It’s no wonder, with shows like “Pluribus,” which are creating landmark cultural moments that audiences are loving. Anticipation is building for upcoming new productions like “Cape Fear” from Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, and we are thrilled to announce that “Ted Lasso” will be returning for a fourth season this summer.</p>\n<p>Six years since launch, we’re excited by the growing enthusiasm viewers have for Apple TV, and we are grateful for the accolades that have followed, most recently at the Critics’ Choice and Golden Globe Awards. To date, Apple TV productions have earned more than 650 wins and more than 3,200 nominations, including a recently announced Oscar nomination for Best Picture for F1: The Movie.</p>\n<p>And speaking of F1, we’re also approaching the start of a new Formula 1 season, and for F1 fans in the U.S., Apple TV will be the place to watch every practice, qualifying, sprint, and Grand Prix. MLS fans will also be able to watch every regular and postseason game with their Apple TV subscription this year, and we’re looking forward to kick off in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Looking back, 2025 was a fantastic year for services as we rolled out amazing new features and broke records. Apple Music climbed to all-time highs in both listenership and new subscriber growth. Apple Pay eliminated more than $1 billion in fraud for our partners last year, and we’ve made it available in more markets than ever before. And last year, we welcomed more than 850 million users every week on average to the App Store, the world’s safest and most innovative app marketplace. Developers have now earned more than $550 billion on our platform since 2008.</p>\n<p>In retail, we continue to bring a magical experience to our customers all around the world, and we were thrilled to have our best-ever results in retail during the quarter. We were excited to open our fifth store in India in December and have plans to open another store in Mumbai soon.</p>\n<p>Wherever we are, we see ourselves as part of a larger whole. That’s why we show up with our values in everything we do. That means working with partners in places like Vietnam to bring more clean water to rural areas. It means celebrating graduations of new classes of innovators from our developer academies in places such as Brazil, Indonesia, and South Korea. It means 3D printing titanium cases for Apple Watch using recycled materials so that they’re better for the planet without compromising quality. And so much more.</p>\n<p>We’re especially proud of the work we’re doing to support American innovation. Last year, we committed to invest $600 billion over four years in vital industries like advanced manufacturing, silicon engineering, and artificial intelligence. As we’re building on our long-standing investments in America, we’re supporting nearly half a million jobs with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states. In the years since we made our initial commitment, we’re making great progress. Today we’re shipping servers to power Apple Intelligence from our new manufacturing facility in Houston. Through our Advanced Manufacturing Program, we’re working with Corning in Kentucky to make 100% of cover glass for iPhone and Apple Watch. We’re working with Micron, which broke ground on a new advanced chip packaging and test facility, and we continue to advance the development of an end-to-end silicon supply chain across the country, sourcing 20 billion U.S. chips in 2025.</p>\n<p>Through our Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit, we’re already training American businesses and innovators on the latest smart manufacturing and artificial intelligence techniques. Six months since opening, the Academy is already making an enormously positive impact for businesses working alongside Apple engineers to drive productivity, efficiency, and quality in their supply chains.</p>\n<p>As I said at the beginning of my remarks, this was, in so many ways, a remarkable quarter for Apple, and we’re excited for all the opportunities we’ll have in the year ahead to deliver innovations that have never been seen before and enrich the lives of users every step of the way. With so much to look forward to in the weeks and months ahead, I have every confidence that our best work is yet to come. With that, I’ll turn it over to Kevan.</p>\n<h2>Kevan Parekh’s opening remarks</h2>\n<p>Thanks Tim, and good afternoon everyone. Our revenue of $143.8 billion was up 16% year-over-year, our best quarter ever. Across the world, we set all-time revenue records in both developed and emerging markets, and we saw double-digit growth year-over-year across a majority of the markets we track, including the U.S., Latin America, Western Europe, Greater China, India, and Japan. in South Asia. Products revenue was $113.7 billion, up 16% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in iPhone, setting a new all-time record. And as Tim mentioned, thanks to our strong levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction, our install base of active devices has now surpassed 2.5 billion, reaching another all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments.</p>\n<p>Services revenue was 30 billion dollars, up 14% year-over-year. This performance continues to be broad-based, with double-digit growth in almost every market we track. We also reached all-time revenue records for advertising, cloud services, music, and payment services, with December supporter records on the App Store and video.</p>\n<p>Company gross margin was at 48.2%, above the high end of our guidance range and up 100 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix and leverage. Products gross margin was 40.7%, up 450 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 76.5%, up 120 basis points sequentially, driven by mix.</p>\n<p>Operating expenses landed at $18.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year. This was within the range we provided, and driven by increased investment in R&amp;D. Net income was $42.1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.84, up 19% year-over-year. Both net income and diluted EPS were all-time records, and these incredibly strong business results drove an all-time record for operating cash flow, coming in at $53.9 billion.</p>\n<p>Now I’m going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories.</p>\n<p>iPhone revenue was $85.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year, driven by the iPhone 17 family. iPhone saw strength around the world, reaching all-time revenue records in many of the markets we track, including the U.S., Greater China, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, Australia, and South Asia, as well as a December quarter record in India. The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high and set a new all-time record for upgraders in aggregate and across many countries, including the U.S., China mainland, Japan, and India. According to a recent survey from World Panel, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the U.K., Australia, and Japan. Customers are loving the latest iPhone lineup. The latest customer satisfaction for the iPhone 17 family in the U.S. was measured at 99 percent by 451 Research.</p>\n<p>Mac revenue was $8.4 billion, down 7 percent year over year. As we described in the last call, we faced a very difficult compare against the M4 MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, and iMac launches in the year-ago quarter. Despite this difficult compare, we continued to see growth in several emerging markets, including Brazil, India, Malaysia, Vietnam, and more. And, as Tim mentioned earlier, the Mac installed base reached another all-time high, with nearly half of the customers who purchased a Mac being new to the product. And in the U.S., customer satisfaction for Mac was measured at 97%.</p>\n<p>iPad revenue was $8.6 billion, up up 6% year over year, driven by the M5-powered iPad Pro and the A16-powered iPad. We continued to add new users to the iPad. In fact, over half the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. This helped the iPad installed base to reach an all-time high, and we also reached an all-time high for upgraders. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 98% in the U.S.</p>\n<p>Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue was $11.5 billion, down 2% year-over-year. During the quarter, we experienced constraints on the AirPods Pro 3, and we believe the overall category would have grown had it not been for these constraints. The wearables installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And in the U.S., customer satisfaction was recently reported at 96%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $30 billion, up 14% year over year. As we said earlier, we had all-time revenue records on advertising, music, payment services, and cloud services, where we saw a double-digit growth on paid subscribers. We continue to be optimistic about the future of our services business. With our installed base of over 2-1/2 billion active devices, we have an incredibly strong foundation for new growth opportunities. We saw increased customer engagement across our service offerings, with both transacting and paid accounts reaching all-time highs in the quarter. And we continue to improve the quality and expand the breadth of our services offerings, from new wallet features like Digital ID, which provides a way for users to create an ID in wallet using information from their U.S. passport, to additional ads coming to search in the App Store, which provides advertisers more ways to drive downloads from search.</p>\n<p>Turning now to Enterprise, organizations are continuing to expand their fleet of Apple devices to drive productivity while remaining secure. Snowflake has deployed over 9,000 Mac devices company-wide, establishing Mac as a primary laptop across all business units, resulting in increased performance and a reduction in support tickets. AstraZeneca is rolling out over 5,000 M5-powered iPad Pros to its pharmaceutical sales team to take advantage of AI capabilities, including Apple Intelligence, while meeting with clinicians daily. And in Mexico, Coppell, the country’s largest domestic retailer, recently added MacBook Air in addition to a growing fleet of over 10,000 iPad devices.</p>\n<p>Let’s turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $145 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $2.2 billion of debt maturities, and decreased commercial paper by $6 billion, resulting in $91 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $54 billion. During the quarter, we returned nearly $32 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $25 billion through open-market repurchases of 93 million Apple shares.</p>\n<p>As we move ahead into the March quarter, I’d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasani referred to. Importantly, the color we’re providing assumes that global tariff rates, policies, and their application remain in effect as of this call and the global macroeconomic outlet does not worsen from today.</p>\n<p>We expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow by 13% to 16% year-over-year. which comprehends our best estimates of constrained iPhone supply during the quarter. We expect Services revenue to grow at a year-over-year rate similar to what we’ve reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 48% and 49%. We expect operating expenses to be between $18.4 billion and $18.7 billion, which is at a similar level to what we reported in the December quarter, and driven by higher R&amp;D on a year-over-year basis. We expect OI&amp;E to be around $100 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 17.5%.</p>\n<p>Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of 26 cents per share of common stock payable on February 12, 2026 to shareholders of record as of February 9, 2026. With that, let’s open to call the questions.</p>\n<h2>Analyst Q&amp;A</h2>\n<p><strong>Amit Daryanani, Evercore</strong>: You know, there’s a lot of focus on the impact of memory to a host of companies, and I’d love to kind of get your perspective. When you folks are guiding gross margins up into the March quarter, just talk about, you know, A, your comfort in securing the bids that you need for shipment, and B, how do we think about memory inflation flowing through Apple’s model over time?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Yeah, Amit, hi, it’s Tim. Let me back up a bit and talk about the constraints that Kevan referred to in his remarks, and memory, and try to get both of these out at once. First of all, we were thrilled with the customer response on the latest iPhone lineup. It exceeded our expectations, to say the least, and, you know, iPhone grew 23%. What the result of that was, was that we exited the December quarter with very lean channel inventory due to that staggering level of demand, and based on that, we’re in a supply chase mode to meet the very high levels of customer demand. We are currently constrained, and at this point it’s difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance. The constraints that we have are driven by the availability of the advanced nodes that our SOCs are produced on, and at this time we’re seeing less flexibility in the supply chain than normal, partly because of our increased demand that I just spoke about.</p>\n<p>From a memory point of view, to answer your question, memory had a minimal impact on the Q1, so the December quarter gross margin. We do expect it to be a bit more of an impact to the Q2 gross margin, and that was comprehended in the outlook of 48% to 49% that Kevan gave earlier. Beyond Q2, we don’t obviously provide outlooks beyond the current quarter, but we do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly. As always, we’ll look at a range of options to deal with that. So hopefully that gives you the full view.</p>\n<p><strong>Amit Daryanani, Evercore</strong>: Thank you, and I appreciate all the clarity on that Tim. Maybe the second question I have for you is, maybe just touch on the China strength you folks had? I think this is very close to all-time high revenues we’ve had in China. What’s driving the strength over here and just part of the durability of the growth rate we saw in the December quarter would be helpful to understand.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Sure. Greater China was up 38% year-on-year. It was driven by iPhone, where we set an all-time revenue record. So it was the best iPhone quarter in history in Greater China. It’s driven by the customer enthusiasm for the iPhone 17 lineup, and I would tell you that during the quarter, traffic in our stores in China grew by strong double digits year over year. It was a terrific quarter. Our installed base reached an all-time high in both greater China and mainland China, and we set an all-time record for the upgraders, and we saw strong double-digit growth on switchers. And according to a survey from World Panel, iPhones were the top three smartphones in urban China during the quarter. And it’s really driven primarily by the product strength and the customer response to the product strength.</p>\n<p>We do see on non-iPhone products, that the majority of customers that are buying a Mac, an iPad, a Watch, are still new to that product. So that’s a very good sign for us, and if you look at iPad, on that same survey, iPad was the top tablet model in urban China. And according to CounterPoint, the MacBook Air was the top selling laptop model and Mac Mini was the top selling desktop model in the December quarter. So overall, great quarter in China. We could not be more happy with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Eric Woodring, Morgan Stanley:</strong> Tim, congrats on announcing the partnership with Google and we’re all excited to see what you bring to market later this year. When I think about your AI initiatives, it’s clear there are added costs associated with that. We’re obviously seeing that flow through an OpEx. Can you help us understand maybe what the revenue upside potential that exists with AI? I mean, many of your competitors have already integrated AI into their devices, and it’s just not clear yet what incremental monetization they’re seeing because of AI. But you’re always disciplined with investing. You obviously have a differentiated product. So how do you monetize AI, and what’s the timeline to realizing that ROI?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Well, let me just say that we’re bringing intelligence to more of what people love and we’re integrating it across the operating system in a personal and private way, and I think that by doing so, it creates great value, and that opens up a range of opportunities across our products and services. And we’re very happy with the collaboration with Google as well, I should add.</p>\n<p><strong>Eric Woodring, Morgan Stanley:</strong> Now that you have kind of more time and data to evaluate this cycle, can you maybe help us understand what the primary factors are driving strength in the iPhone? I’m sure there’s a number of factors, but if you had to point to one or two, just what would they be and how sustainable do you think those are?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: I think it’s different for different cohorts of where people are coming from and the device that they have. But it’s a combination of things, always, that make the products sing. It’s the display, it’s the camera, it’s the performance, it’s the new selfie camera, it’s the design—the design is beloved—and so it’s all of these things that come together at once and are producing a very strong product cycle as witnessed by our December quarter results.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Ng, Goldman Sachs</strong> It was encouraging to hear about the revenue growth outlook of 13% to 16% for the March quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk about any comps that we should be particularly aware of as we kind of think about each of the product categories. I know last year, you guys had MacBook Air with M4, the iPhone 16e, the iPad with A16, and the iPad Air with M3. So just wanted to ask if those things would create tough comps, or is it just less of an issue just given the new product outlook?</p>\n<p><strong>Kevan Parekh</strong>: Yeah, Mike. It’s Kevan. How are you? Thanks for the question. Yeah, I wouldn’t say there’s any particular comp issue that we’d note. As you recall, last quarter, we talked about the difficult comparison we had on Mac, but there’s nothing that rises to that kind of color that we’d outline in the outlook, and so I think it’s just continuation of the strong cycle we’re seeing, subject to the constraints that I had mentioned in the prepared remarks and that Tim alluded to a little earlier, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Ng, Goldman Sachs</strong>  And, just on Services, advertising strong in the quarter, I wanted to ask about some of the new growth opportunities in advertising. I know you guys are doing the new ad slots in the App Store. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about that, and then any plans to do more in advertising across other products like Maps or TV.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevan Parekh</strong>: Sure, Michael, what I’d say just if I step back in general, I think as we outlined, we saw really good broad-based performance in our Services business. So ranging from all-time records and advertising, music, payment services, and cloud services. So I think we see really good opportunities across a lot of our service categories, and we continue to add new service offerings. We talked about what we added to the Wallet, like digital ID, and you referenced the additional ads coming in the search in the App Store, which we are excited about. It provides advertisers more ways to be discovered, and so I think we’ll continue to look for ways to expand opportunities to add value to users and also create opportunities for Apple. I think as we talked about, we crossed a really significant milestone at 2.5 billion active devices, so we really feel excited about the opportunity that provides for our services business as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben Reitzes, Mellius</strong>: Hey, guys. How are you?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Hi, Ben.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben Reitzes, Mellius</strong>: Hey, Tim. First question is on Google partnership again. I wanted to understand how you came to that decision with regard to the AI and Siri in particular and if there’s an opportunity for you guys to share in revenue too with that partnership like you do in search.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Yeah, we basically determined that Google’s AI technology would provide the most capable foundation for AFM (Apple Foundation Models), and we believe that we can unlock a lot of experiences and innovate in a key way due to the collaboration. We’ll continue to run on the device and run in Private Cloud Compute and maintain our industry-leading privacy standards in doing so. In terms of the arrangement with Google, we’re not releasing the details of that.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben Reitzes, Mellius</strong>: Bummer. Okay. I tried.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: [<em>Laughs.</em>] You did.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben Reitzes, Mellius</strong>: So, yeah, you knew it would be me.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: [<em>Laughs.</em>]</p>\n<p><strong>Ben Reitzes, Mellius</strong>:  So, the next question is on gross margin. You know, I’m pretty shocked. I got to hand it to you, Tim, that you’re able to do 48 to 49. What’s really going on there? How are you doing that with this memory, the NAND prices? Is it due to mix that there’s less hardware and more services, and services margins are going up, how are you doing it? To keep it at 48 to 49?</p>\n<p><strong>Kevan Parekh</strong>: Yeah, Ben, this is Kevan. How are you doing? Well, let me start maybe by just reflecting on the Q1 gross margin. I think we talked about the fact that we landed at 48.2%. So, just above the high end of the range that we provided, you know, on the last call, and I think if you look at that performance, we were up 100 basis points sequentially. We talked about the fact that we had favorable mix. As you know, when we have a good product cycle, a strong product cycle we’re seeing for iPhone, that does lend itself to a bit more favorable opportunity on the mix and leverage side. So, we’re having a strong iPhone cycle, as Tim outlined, and so that also translated itself. We talked about products sequentially went up by 450 basis points. So I think in general, I think we’re just seeing favorable mix dynamics as well. You know, services continues to contribute as well. That business is growing double digits. So that also is a contributor. And I think we looked at our guidance,we’re providing a similar range to where we reported in December, and there’s going to be a few puts and takes. You know, we do expect to see favorable mix into services. As you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, that tends to be the case, and that’s partly offset by seasonal loss of leverage. So there’ll be puts and takes, but, again, we feel pretty good about the guide of 48 to 49%, which is similar to the range we reported in December.</p>\n<p><strong>David Vogt, UBS</strong>: Maybe if we could pull out a little bit, can you help us understand how you’re thinking about the overall kind of smartphone market demand, particularly given where memory prices are headed? We’ve heard some conversations with some other OEMs as well as component providers that are worried about either the availability of components, potential market weakness in terms of demand destruction, if some of the actions to offset are higher prices. I know you don’t give out looks for the full year, but how are you thinking about all of those different vectors and what that might mean for the overall smartphone market and then ultimately what that might mean for demand for iPhones as we move through the rest of this calendar year.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Yeah, on the supply side, I had made comments earlier about the constraint that we are seeing in Q2, and that’s reflected in the revenue guidance that Kevan gave earlier. The constraint, as I’d mentioned, is due to the advanced node capacity, and it’s really a result of growing so well in Q1 with the 23% and having less flexibility partly due to that in the process to increase it as much as we would like to increase it. Beyond Q2, I don’t really want to comment on supply. Supply is the function of a lot of things in the industry that move around a lot, so I wouldn’t want to comment on that. And I commented before on memory pricing, and so hopefully that answers your question. Oh, in terms of smartphone demand— You know, we believe that, based on the information that we’ve got, is we gained share in the December quarter. Obviously, the market wasn’t growing at 23%, so we feel good about doing that, but I wouldn’t want to predict how the market reacts in the future. It’s very difficult to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>David Vogt, UBS</strong>: Got it. At the risk of not getting this answered, I’m going to follow up with: Can you maybe help us understand… you mentioned there’s a range of options that you’re looking at. How should we think about kind of like LTAs in the marketplace, is that an option as we move through the year, or is it more spot-based on a perspective particularly around memory, just trying to get a better sense for how we should think about the dynamics in the marketplace?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: It’s a range, and so I don’t want to get more specific than that. They’re different levers that we can push, and who knows how successful they’ll be, but there’s just a range of options.</p>\n<p><strong>Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America</strong>: Tim, on Services you grew a pretty impressive 14%, and I know you said that the App Store with a record for the December quarter, but third-party data is showing a notable deceleration in App Store growth, maybe 7% of the December quarter relative to your 14% growth. I was hoping if you could maybe confirm that and secondarily, if it’s correct, what might be some of the drivers of that and what could be things that you could do to reverse that in future quarters?</p>\n<p><strong>Kevan Parekh</strong>: Hey, Wamsi. It’s Kevan here. Look, I think I want to reiterate the fact that during the summer quarter, we had a quarterly record on the App Store? As you know, we don’t provide specific color on how the individual services categories have done. But, again, if we step back, I think we saw, again, broad-based growth across all the different categories, also across various geographies. We had all-time records in both developed and emerging markets as well, and double-digit in both of those, too, and so I think in general, you know, we don’t provide you know the color at the detailed services level.</p>\n<p><strong>Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America</strong>: Okay, thanks, Kevan. I guess back to the memory price. I appreciate you have a range of options to address that. Historically, Apple’s not used a pricing lever unless FX markets got maybe very dislocated to prevent arbitrage or issues like that, but given some of these unprecedented moves in memory, would pricing be a lever that you would be willing to pull or push outside of everything else that you can do?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Yeah, I wouldn’t want to speculate on that one.</p>\n<p><strong>Samik Chatterjee, JP Morgan</strong>: I’m just looking at your capital investment in the first quarter, which did moderate from the last one, and wondering if the partnership with Google on Gemini and sort of help collaboration to develop the next generation of Apple foundational models, does that have any near term sort of impact on your intent to use Apple Private Cloud? I know you emphasize sort of the role Apple private cloud plays in the long term, but are there any changes on that front through this collaboration? Any thoughts around that?</p>\n<p><strong>Kevan Parekh</strong>: I think this is Kevan here. I think in general, as Tim outlined, we weren’t going to provide any details on our arrangement and collaboration with Google. Just speaking of CapEx in general, as you know, we have a hybrid model for CapEx, and so I think that what happens is, our CapEx can be volatile, independent of kind of the volume of performance of our business. And as you know, our CapEx is made of several different line items that include tooling, our facilities, investments in our retail store, data centers, and on tooling and data centers, we leverage this hybrid model that I mentioned before, which we leverage a combination of first and third party capacity. So in general, it’s hard to read into the CapEx and draw any conclusions. So I think I would just say there’s gonna be some ebbs and flows in CapEx. Last year, remember, we did build out our Private Cloud Compute environment, and so we did have CapEx spending related to that in our results in December.</p>\n<p><strong>Samik Chatterjee, JP Morgan</strong>: You did mention product gross margin and the sort of drivers there for the product gross margin improvement. When you sort of highlighted mix as a driver, can you just sort of talk through what are the big differences in mix you’re seeing for iPhone 17 versus 16? And tariffs, tariffs coming in more favorable play a role at all, and what are you expecting for tariffs for the next quarter?</p>\n<p><strong>Kevan Parekh</strong>: Yeah, so there’s a few things to unpack there. So on the overall margin on product side, I think I mentioned that we had favorable mix of products and leverage. I think given the strong iPhone cycle we’re seeing, that was, I would say, probably a higher favorability than you might have seen in maybe other cycles, and as well, as you know, in Q1, typically we do see the impact of the cost structure of our new products that we launch. And in this case, we are seeing a more favorable offset from mix of products and leverage versus historical sequential changes from Q4 to Q1. On the tariff piece, we had outlined an amount of $1.4 billion for the December quarter, and we landed roughly in that range and at that level.</p>\n<p><strong>Krish Sankar, TD Cowen</strong>: Tim, I think you touched upon this earlier on the Gemini integration and Apple Foundation Model. How to think about the difference between Apple Foundation model functionality and third-party models? Does the Apple Foundation Model evolve to a different layer in the AI software stack? How to think about it as you partner with third-party frontier models?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Yeah, Krish, you should think of it as a collaboration. And we’ll obviously independently continue to do some of our own stuff, but you should think of what is going to power the personalized version of Siri as a collaboration with Google.</p>\n<p><strong>Krish Sankar, TD Cowen</strong>: Got it. So, a quick follow up, just a lot of discussion on memory pricing. Given that the memory constraint or commodity scarcity is impacting both the smartphone and the PC markets, and Apple arguably having more purchasing power. Do you think this is a chance for you to increase your market share both in iPhone and Mac at the expense of competition who might have more constraints in getting access to memory?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Yeah, I don’t really want to talk about kind of what has happened, and we do believe as I had shared that iPhone gained share in the December quarter, and if you look at Mac for the full calendar year of ’25, we also believe we gained share, and so we feel very good about our position.</p>\n<p><strong>Atif Malik, Citi</strong>: Tim, some of the industry pundits are comparing the iPhone 17 upgrade cycle to the 2020-2021 years, as some of the iPhone 12-13 users upgrade. Curious if you agree with that view, and also if you can layer on the impact from Apple Intelligence to the refresh rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: I think each iPhone cycle has its own unique characteristics, and so I wouldn’t compare it to a specific one. I think iPhone 17, the family of 17, is a unique product that brings several very compelling features in one product and it has done extremely well, and so we feel quite good about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevan Parekh</strong>: And I’ll just add to Tim’s comment that we talked about the fact that we have a large and diverse installed base of customers, and so this product has really resonated with multiple cohorts, whether you’re on older devices or newer iPhones as well. So we’ve seen really strong reaction to the product lineup.</p>\n<p><strong>Atif Malik, Citi</strong>: There was a lot of discussion on supply constraints, and I’m surprised that you guys are constrained on advanced packaging as you generally get your share at the big foundry. How long will these supply [constraints] impact your ability to ship through demand?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: It’s difficult to estimate demand when you haven’t met the demand. And so obviously we have internal estimates on that, but I don’t want to share those. But it’s very difficult. And just to be clear, it’s the advanced nodes, like three nanometer to be specific, where the latest SOCs are produced on, as to what is gating the Q2 supply. And it’s a direct result of the 23% growth and that far outstripping what we had internally estimated and having more limited flexibility in the supply chain for some period of time. But I don’t want to estimate when supply and demand will balance at this point.</p>\n<p><strong>Aaron Rakers, Wells Fargo</strong>: I’ll try and stay away from the memory question. I’m curious, and, obviously hearing a lot of focus on the China demand, but I’m curious, you also called out India, and so, can you maybe unpack some of the things that you’re seeing in the Indian market as far as iPhone traction—any kind of color on what is a very large install base in India that seems to be a good growth opportunity for Apple still?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Yeah, thanks for the question. We did set a quarterly revenue record during the December quarter, and to go a little further down, we set quarterly revenue records on iPhone and Mac and iPad, and an all-time revenue record on Services. So it was a terrific quarter in India. We really like what we see there. It’s the second-largest smartphone market in the world and the fourth largest PC market. And we still have, despite very nice growth history, we have modest share there, and so we think there’s a huge opportunity for us there, and we could not be more excited about it. The other thing that I would point out is that the majority of customers that are buying iPhone and Mac and iPad and Watch are all new to that product and so it speaks very well to opportunity there.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevan Parekh</strong>: Yeah, and Aaron, I heard you mention the installed base. We’re seeing strong double digit growth in the install base in India as well, which is really encouraging.</p>\n<p><strong>Aaron Rakers, Wells Fargo</strong>: Part of this current generation iPhone cycle is, you clearly deepened some of your own internal silicon capabilities on the device. I’m curious if we should think about that as a lever and maybe a supportive factor to gross margin that might be underappreciated? Any thoughts on where we go from here as far as continual opportunities of internalizing your own silicon.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Yeah, I’ll let Kevan talk about the gross margin, but in terms of the product, which is at the heart of what we think about in the user, Apple silicon has just been a incredible game changer for us, starting with iPhone, and then on iPad, and of course the Mac as of a few years ago. And so we believe it’s a game changer and a major competitive advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevan Parekh</strong>: Yeah, and as far as impact on gross margin, we have been, as you know, investing in core technologies like our own silicon, our own modem, and certainly while those do provide opportunities for cost savings and can be reflected in margins, they also, importantly, provide the differentiation that’s really important for our products as well, and give us more control over our roadmap. So I think there’s a lot of strategic value to it, but also we are seeing investments in our core technologies impacting gross margins in a positive way.</p>\n<p><strong>Richard Kramer, Arete Research</strong>: Tim, when you think about how Apple might manage AI, do you see that evolving towards more edge AI or on-device services versus cloud-based AI? And are you confident you’ve reserved sufficient data center capacity to support the widespread Siri adoption, especially given that you’re not following the other hyperscalers and sharply increasing CapEx?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: The answer is that we see both being important, the on-device and the Private Cloud Compute, and so we don’t see it as an either/or, we see it as a both, and we believe it’s a differentiator because of our privacy approach. In terms of, do we have enough capacity? It’s hard to estimate with precision what the demand will be. But we’ve done sort of the best job that we can do, and either have or are putting capacity in for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Richard Kramer, Arete Research</strong>: Okay, and you mentioned the 2.5 billion active device number, but Apple Intelligence features have only been available since the 15 Pro. So can you speak at all to roughly what portion of your iPhone or overall active device install base is now AI-capable, and has this been a factor in maybe a more gradual pace of launching wider AI services?</p>\n<p><strong>Kevan Parekh</strong>: Yeah, Richard, this is Kevan. You know, we don’t provide that specific number, but it is a growing number, as you can imagine, in our install base, and so we’re encouraged by the amount of devices now that are capable. But we’re not going to provide a specific figure on that today.</p>\n<p><strong>Richard Kramer, Arete Research</strong>: Okay, well. I had to try.

      "content": "<p>Apple <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-acquires-audio-ai-startup-qai-2026-01-29/\">confirmed to Reuters</a> today that it has acquired an Israeli startup called Q.ai, which uses artificial intelligence technology to analyze audio:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Apple did not disclose terms of the deal or what Q.ai’s technology will be used for, but said the startup has worked on new applications of machine learning to help devices understand whispered speech and to enhance audio in challenging environments. In a statement, [CEO Aviad] Maizels said “joining Apple opens extraordinary possibilities for pushing boundaries and realizing the full potential of what we’ve created, and we’re thrilled to bring these experiences to people everywhere.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Maizels was also the founder of PrimeSense, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/222457/apple-acquires-3d-sensing-technology-company-primesense.html\">which Apple acquired back in 2013</a> and used as part of the basis for Face ID. Two of Q.ai’s co-founders will be joining the company as well. Though Apple didn’t confirm the price tag, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49f4e2e4-3a68-4842-be67-879409d06aa1\">the <em>Financial Times</em> has reported</a> (paywalled) that the deal was worth almost $2 billion, which would make it the company’s second biggest acquisition after the 2014 purchase of Beats for $3 billion.<sup id=\"fnref-38302-inflation\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38302-inflation\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>There were lots of rumors in the last year that Apple might purchase an AI company to offset the challenges it’s had in the market; in the end, Apple <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2026/01/apple-will-base-its-foundation-models-on-googles-gemini/\">opted to partner with Google</a> to provide foundation models for its technology.</p>\n<p>Overall, this feels more like a traditional Apple acquisition: a smaller company, more targeted in its use case, with talented staff that it can bring onboard. Apple’s already done plenty with machine learning around audio (including the translation features of the AirPods Pro and different audio modes in videos shot on the iPhone), and this would set them up well for improving everything from microphone performance to perhaps some of its live captioning features—perhaps in a future smart glasses product, for example.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-38302-inflation\">\nAdjusting for inflation, though…woof. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-38302-inflation\" title=\"Return to main content.\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-acquires-audio-ai-startup-qai-2026-01-29/\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2026/01/apple-acquires-audio-ai-startup-for-2-billion/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>",

Developers are quite familiar with how limited Apple’s back-end systems are and how they can inflict frustration on developers and customers alike. But it’s another level when the same thing happens to Apple and its own apps.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/numbers-new-side-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of an alert: Green icon with bar chart. Text: 'Use the New Version of Numbers. Numbers 14.5 is out of date and can be deleted.' Buttons: 'Open New Version' (green) and 'Not Now' (gray).\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>For example, yesterday the <em>old</em> versions of Numbers, Pages, and Keynote were updated, apparently with the only new feature being a dialog box that appears when you launch it that says “Use the New Version of Numbers,” with a button to Open New Version.</p>\n<p>Why? Seems like Apple has chosen this moment to unify the iPad and Mac versions of Numbers and its fellow apps in a single entity in the App Store, and that leaves the old versions high and dry. The right thing to do here would be to gracefully migrate that Mac app and merge it with the other apps, but apparently not even Apple can convince itself to prioritize a feature that would make the launch of its new suite a little less clunky.</p>\n<p>I’m also struck by the fact that Apple has had to do the App Store trick of attaching subtitles to the names of every app it makes, because the design of the App Store has led to stuffing keywords into titles becoming somehow a best practice. So it’s not Final Cut Pro anymore, it’s “Final Cut Pro: Create Video.” And Numbers is “Numbers: Make Spreadsheets.”</p>\n<p>Also confusing: Double apps! Right now, I see two versions of Final Cut Pro in the Mac App Store. They’re actually the same app, but one is the original app that someone might have purchased in the past, and the other is a bundled edition that is tied to the iPad version and available by subscription. They have different icons, but otherwise seem to be identical, version 12.0.</p>\n<p>I’ve complained a bunch about Apple converting its free iWork apps into freemium apps with paid upsells (to a bundle that’s a bad fit for many users), but that was <em>before</em> I saw that if you don’t subscribe to the bundle, the new versions of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@somelinguist/115973663735852267\">include ads attached to interface elements</a> promoting the Creator Studio. The first-launch screen and two prominent menu items under the application menu push the Creator Studio. There’s also a prominent toolbar button for the suite-included Content Hub so that you can browse all that great premium clip media—but if you insert it, it’s watermarked, because you haven’t subscribed.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/template-ad-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"The screenshot shows a spreadsheet app interface with a sidebar listing template categories and a main section highlighting 'Elevate Your Spreadsheets' with Apple Creator Studio templates. Below, there's a 'Blank' template preview and a 'Basic' option. At the bottom, there are buttons for Cancel and Create.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Making a new file? You’ll see an upsell for Creator Studio.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Finally, a word about the suite’s new app icons, which I specifically did <em>not</em> address in my review. It’s very easy and fun to complain about icons because art is entirely subjective. You can like what you like. I will say this: The early days of OS X icons were a reaction to the incredibly limited icon palette of classic Mac OS, so apps often offered incredibly detailed, photorealistic icons to represent themselves. It felt so modern. And many of those icons were beautiful.</p>\n<p>But let’s forget about art for a moment and consider utility. Where do we interact with icons? For me, it’s the home screen on my iPad and iPhone, and the Dock and Spotlight launcher on my Mac. In every context, these icons are very small, far too small for a gorgeous skeuomorphic icon.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the brief given to the designers of the new Creator Studio icon set was to make them all differentiated by color and shape. While I don’t love a lot of the choices they made—there are a lot of metaphors that seem to have drifted so far from reality that they make no sense anymore—I have to admit that they are all different silhouettes and colors, which means I know that the green bar chart that looks like it’s giving me the finger is Numbers when it’s in my Dock.</p>\n<p>Should Apple aspire to better than utility, even when it comes to something as far away from mission-critical as app icons? Yes, it should. And I don’t think the people who are complaining about app icons are <em>really</em> complaining about app icons. They’re pointing out a symptom of a larger disease, which is Apple losing its way when it comes to usability and software design.</p>\n<p>But if you’ll forgive me, I find it hard to get too worked up about icon designs when Apple is putting ads for a professional creative suite in its free productivity apps. Which is the greater offense to the user experience?</p>\n",

(I do generate some podcasts in Final Cut Pro and Logic both, and have used them for years, but I’m definitely one of those people who uses a tenth of their features.)</p>\n<p>Still, I’m a big fan of both apps. These are substantial apps that Apple continues to invest development resources in, and moving them to a subscription model makes me optimistic that they’ll continue to grow and evolve.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/transcript-search-fcp-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"A laptop screen displays video editing software with a large preview of a man speaking in front of cars.

Audio of footage is now transcribed and searchable, so you can find the location in a particular clip where someone says a particular phrase or even covers a specific topic. Similarly, video is indexed so that you can search for items and actions that appear in the video. If you’re managing lots of footage across a lot of clips, this will be a productivity boost. There’s also support for Beat Detection, which makes it easier to snap clips to the rhythm of any music track. (Final Cut Pro scans music and detects where the beats are.)</p>\n<p>Specifically on the iPad version of Final Cut, Apple has added support for multiple selections (great for batch adjustments, which in the past I’ve had to do one at a time) and support for using an external monitor for preview.

So I can’t really address the new features in Logic Pro 12 very well.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/logic-synth-player-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"A laptop screen displays a digital audio workstation with a waveform editor and a synth plugin.

There’s a new Chord ID feature that uses AI to analyze audio and detect what chords are being played. The Mac app now has access to the same downloadable stock packages previously available only in the iPad version. And on the iPad, there’s support for a wild new feature that lets you swipe multiple takes together in order to build the perfect final track.</p>\n<p>It also still edits podcasts.</p>\n<p>A little more than a year ago, <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2024/11/apple-buys-pixelmator/\">Apple bought Pixelmator</a>. Clearly, that purchase was designed to add a photo-and-illustration editor to Apple’s creative professional offerings.</p>\n<p>I am, alas, a person broken by Photoshop in the 1990s and not yet reformed. (I pay Adobe roughly the same for that privilege as you would for this entire bundle, by the way.) But even I, as a Photoshop Sicko, can appreciate how good Pixelmator Pro is—not just on the Mac, but now on the iPad for the very first time.</p>\n<p>For its Apple debut, Pixelmator Pro 4 for Mac adds a new version of the Warp tool. But the real big news is that the whole thing is on the iPad for the first time, complete with Apple Pencil support and full document compatibility with the Mac version.</p>\n<p>As Joe Rosensteel pointed out earlier this month, this suite is <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2026/01/whats-the-real-value-in-creator-studio/\">missing a photography component</a> equivalent to Adobe’s Lightroom. Will that ultimately be Photomator Pro? A freemium update to Photos? Something else? There’s room for more stuff in this bundle, is what I’m saying.</p>\n\n<h2>Productivity for creators?</h2>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hot-topics-content-hub-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of a presentation slide titled 'Hot Topics in Apple' with a red background and a child holding an apple.

(Apple says Freeform will gain suite integration at a later time.) All three apps get access to Content Hub, a media library full of photos and illustrations that can be integrated into projects for all three apps. There are also a bunch of new “premium” templates that add more options for people who don’t want to create that flyer or presentation all by themselves.</p>\n<p>I like the Content Hub, which is accessible from the toolbar and is searchable and filterable by media type. I was able to very quickly pick out a background image for a slide and an illustration to use on a birthday card, for example. I pay an annual subscription for access to a limited number of stock media images from a library; it’s very nice that Apple is rolling this library into the Creator Studio subscription.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/premium-keynote-themes-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"The interface lists categories like All Themes, Recents, and Business on the left.

Options to Generate and Create are at the bottom.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Does this mean Apple’s never going to make new free Keynote templates?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I’m a little less excited about the templates, which feel “premium” more in the sense that they’re not available to the people who aren’t paying. They didn’t really feel that much more creator-focused than any other Keynote or Pages template would. Shouldn’t Apple be making an effort to make nicer templates for <em>all</em> users of those apps? Does the introduction of premium templates mean that Apple’s no longer motivated to create new templates for everyone else? The whole thing just hits me wrong.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/keynote-generative-image-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of a digital note with text: 'iPad windowing mode (Slide Over soon), Local audio capture on iPad &amp; iPhone, AI in Shortcuts.' Includes an image of an iPad displaying a landscape. Sidebar shows note thumbnails and editing options.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>I generated this illustration to go with my presentation.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Content Hub also prominently features a prompt to create images using generative AI. I get why they’re doing it, and I have friends who heavily use AI image generation to build art for presentations. I don’t really appreciate most of the AI-generated imagery I’ve seen, and when I asked Apple to modify a photo from the Content Hub, the result was (predictably) a little uncanny and modified other areas of the photo in ways I found unsettling. So… your mileage may vary.</p>\n<p>Also, I should point out that most of the AI features Apple is adding to these apps, including the image generation, are using OpenAI as the model source. It’s all properly disclaimed and explained—I just wonder whether this is a long-term partnership or if Apple will switch them all over to new, Google-supplied models as soon as it can. For now, it’s all ChatGPT, and given that every AI query has a cost, I can completely understand why these features are limited to subscribers only. (Apple says that users will get 100 tokens per month to use on AI image generation—essentially, the ability to generate about 100 images.)</p>\n<p>Other AI features in Keynote include the ability to generate slides out of text and generate presenter notes out of slides. I tried this out and found it to be, again unsurprisingly, kind of mediocre. It did generate a bunch of slides from my notes for a presentation, but it was all pretty uninspired and had errors due to the AI misunderstanding my notes. I was left with a Keynote deck I’d still need to spend a lot of time getting up to par.</p>\n<p>I also found the presenter notes a bit uninspiring, but I can at least see the concept that converting a bunch of bullet points into actual sentences might be helpful for some presenters.</p>\n<p>There’s apparently an AI-driven “pattern analysis model” that allows Numbers to magically suggest the contents of table cells, but I haven’t seen that one in action. It feels like something that might actually be useful, but I can’t vouch for it.</p>\n<p>I like the fact that Apple has imported the Super Resolution feature from Pixelmator into the iWork apps. This lets you take an image that might be a little too low-resolution for your purposes, and use a local AI algorithm to artificially increase its resolution by up to 300%. You can just right-click on an image in Keynote, for example, and choose Super Resolution. It’s really nice integration.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some integration just isn’t there. In Keynote, for example, you can use an image as a fill for a chart. I decided to see if I could find an illustration of money that I could use in one of my Apple financial-results charts. I could, but I couldn’t use it in the chart. The Numbers interface requires that you pick an image from the filesystem, with no connection to the Content Hub. It gives the distinct feeling that these apps were somewhat hastily added to this Creator Studio bundle.</p>\n<h2>The price of it all</h2>\n<p>Is a bundle that costs $13 a month or $129 a year a good deal or a bad deal? It all depends on what your needs are and what the other options are. If you have very little budget, you might be able to get by with free apps like <a href=\"https://www.affinity.studio\">Affinity Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve\">DaVinci Resolve</a> and <a href=\"https://lmms.io\">LMMS</a>. You can also subscribe to the Adobe apps for the very high price of $839 a year! (Also, good news for students and teachers: You’re eligible to pay only $3/month or $30/year for these apps.)</p>\n<p>If you’re an existing subscriber to Final Cut or Logic for the iPad, you can continue to pay for just those plans, but no new single-app subscriptions will be available. This is a mandatory bundle. If you prefer to buy software and keep it “forever” (until the next full upgrade, anyway), Apple will sell one-time-purchase versions of the Mac apps for $300 (Final Cut), $200 (Logic), $50 (Pixelmator Pro, Motion, and Compressor), and $30 (MainStage). Existing owners of those Mac apps will just get these updates for free.</p>\n<p>To sum up, Apple’s apps are really quite good. Pixelmator Pro gives them yet another one, and it’s a fitting companion. These are nice updates, with some thoughtful new features. While it feels inevitable that Apple would switch these apps to a subscription model, it’s so late in the game that it really does feel like the end of an era.</p>\n<p>If you rely on even one of these apps, $129/year does not seem unreasonable.  As someone who <em>somewhat</em> relies on both Final Cut and Logic, and has spent time learning both of them, that price seems acceptable, so long as the updates and new features keep coming. And I get Pixelmator in the deal? Hmm. It’s so good that I might even be tempted to drop Photoshop eventually, but don’t hold me to that.</p>\n<p>So in the end, I am predisposed to view this new bundle positively. It’s only the clumsy inclusion of Pages, Keynote, Numbers (and later Freeform) that gives things a sour taste. Apple could solve this problem by offering a lower-priced productivity suite, and perhaps communicating how it will determine which features of those apps are for everyone and which ones are only available for those who pay. I didn’t expect the iWork apps to catch strays from the launch of an impressive professional creative suite from Apple, but here we are.</p>\n",

Younger folks might have cut their teeth on Eudora and other Mac apps (back when we called them “software programs”) that could seamlessly log into a mail server, retrieve email locally, and let us interact with it. The first widely successful protocol of that type was Post Office Protocol (POP).<sup id=\"fnref-38184-POP\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38184-POP\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>POP’s job was to download mail. If you left it on the server, it was just a giant mailbox. However, it was all we had, <em>and we liked it!</em><sup id=\"fnref-38184-LIKED\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38184-LIKED\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>POP is now over 40 years old and has been effectively superseded by IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) for decades. The easiest comparison between the two is that POP is like a huge stack of printed messages, while IMAP is a desk organizer with labels in which paper has been sorted for easy retrieval.<sup id=\"fnref-38184-memory\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38184-memory\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">3</a></sup></p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/alexander-grey-tn57JI3CewI-unsplash.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Image of stack of messy mixed papers of various types and colors\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Simulated appearance of POP email organization.

(I only switched to IMAP in the late 2010s.) Six Color reader Neil writes is one of those people. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I have over 20 years of email, and several accounts, on my Mac, all housed in Apple’s Mail.app, categorized in several dozen folders (but my “All Inboxes” has grown to almost 10,000 emails – sigh).…it didn’t matter because I didn’t have a second email client reading the same emails.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, because he now reads email on multiple devices, he’s found POP frustrating. He wants to migrate to IMAP, but his host doesn’t offer a migration path while retaining the same mailbox. He has to delete his old POP mailbox and create a new IMAP account. Of course, he doesn’t want to lose any of the email archive that he’s left stowed online in the POP account.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  My hunch is that it is doable (maybe even straightforward), but I’m afraid to just try it for fear of losing some or all of my archives.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I can bring good tidings: there’s no technical issue with migrating your email from POP to IMAP, and you won’t lose anything if you take care. The less-good news: it requires some methodical work and a bit of patience.</p>\n<h2>Why POP stuck around so long</h2>\n<p>POP’s appeal was always its simplicity. Your email client downloaded messages from the server with an option to delete them afterward (or after a set period). Because of storage limits, you could typically keep a relatively small number of messages on the server, and regularly had to move everything else to local storage on your Mac. The server was mostly a temporary repository.</p>\n<p>This worked well in a mostly single-device era, or when we had a desktop computer in one location and a laptop in the other. I developed a habit of using POP to read email on my laptop by having the email app on that computer download messages without deleting them. I would then download and delete the messages on my desktop computer and sort them into folders.<sup id=\"fnref-38184-READ\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38184-READ\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">4</a></sup> That kept my mailbox from getting too huge, but I could read email away from my desktop.</p>\n<p>Once you had multiple devices on which you wanted to read email, everything went out the window for POP. IMAP’s first version appeared not that long after POP’s initial release, but it took many more years for companies offering mail services to adopt IMAP. This was almost certainly because mail hosts had constrained storage space—as did we all—and pushed their users to download mail, something POP was well-suited for. As storage costs plummeted and people wanted more access to the same email in different locations, IMAP’s higher computational and storage needs made financial sense. (Or, with Google and Gmail, competitive sense.)</p>\n<p>IMAP treats the server as the source of “truth.” Your mail client shows you what’s on the server, and actions you take—reading, deleting, filing into folders—sync back. Multiple devices see the same state. I have more gigabytes of storage than I need on most of my email hosts, so I can leave email there indefinitely. (Leaving your mail on solely on a server comes with huge risks! I’ll write about that sometime.)</p>\n<p>The slight catch for longtime POP users is, of course, that all that mail you’ve accumulated over the years is likely just on your Mac, not on a server. You may need to do a few kinds of copying.</p>\n<h2>Download all those messages as a new archive</h2>\n<p>Having 10,000 messages on a server, whether POP or IMAP, personally makes me nervous. I’m not sure if Neil—or you, dear reader—has made a local copy of those emails, but his note indicates he’s filed some into folders, which indicates local storage.</p>\n<p>The only way to ensure you have retrieved every message locally from a POP email server before deleting them is to perform a clean download. If you set up another account for the same mail host in Mail in your regular macOS account, I’m concerned about the conflicts that could result.</p>\n<p>Instead, I suggested setting up a new macOS account, which can be temporary, for the most likely successful outcome. Here’s how:</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/macpop40-bordered.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of POP mail settings in Mail for Mac\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Mail’s POP account settings let you choose to leave messages on the server or delete them after retrieval.</figcaption></figure>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1386586/debugging-macos-use-fresh-user-account.html\">Create a new macOS account</a>, then log into it.</li>\n<li>Launch Mail and follow prompts to duplicate your email account set up for POP in that account.</li>\n<li>Set the download option to keep messages, not delete them, after retrieval.</li>\n<li>Choose Mailbox: New Mailbox, and then choose On My Mac, and name the mailbox something identifiable, like <code>downloaded POP email</code>.</li>\n<li>You can’t drag the Inbox folder to the On My Mac section, but you can click the POP Inbox folder, choose Edit: Select All, then drag the file selection on top of the new On My Mac folder you just created.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After the messages have downloaded, you can create an archive that you can import later if you need to:</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/import-mbox-into-apple-mail-bordered.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of mailbox import dialog from Mail for Mac\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Apple Mail lets you import messages in the standard mailbox format.</figcaption></figure>\n<ol>\n<li>Control/right-click the mailbox under On My Mac.</li>\n<li>Choose Export Mailbox. </li>\n<li>Select a location to save the mailbox that you can access from your main account.</li>\n<li>Log out of this account and log back into your main macOS account.

If you haven’t followed the steps in the previous section, you should return to it and download all your messages via POP, then copy them locally.</p>\n<p>As always, start with a backup. Make sure your Mac is backed up (always good advice), and then, in particular, that the Mail folder at <code>~/Library/Mail</code> is completely up to date. If you’re using a different email app, make sure you know where it keeps its local mail store, and back that up.</p>\n<p>Now you can proceed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Delete all the messages from your POP mailbox on the mail host.

This might be a good overnight operation after you get it started and make sure it’s copying as expected. Double-check your storage limits on the server, too, so you don’t exceed the maximum space, which can interrupt an upload.</p>\n<h2>For further reading</h2>\n<p>Joe Kissell’s <em><a href=\"https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/apple-mail/?pt=6COLORS\">Take Control of Apple Mail</a></em> explains setting up accounts across Mac, iPhone, and iPad, as well as plugins, automation, and solving common problems.</p>\n<p>He’s also got a new title out, <em><a href=\"https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/mailmaven/?pt=6COLORS\">Take Control of MailMaven</a></em>, which explains the ins and outs of migrating and using a sophisticated, newly released email app.</p>\n<p>[<em>Got a question for the column?

      "title": "Picking up the missing pieces of Apple’s Creator Studio",
      "link": "https://sixcolors.com/post/2026/01/whats-the-real-value-in-creator-studio/",
      "content": "<p>In October, I <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/10/creative-neglect-what-about-the-apps-in-apple/\">wrote a little piece</a> about how I was concerned over the lack of a clear strategy with Apple’s creativity apps—in particular, the recently-acquired Pixelmator and Photomator, as well as the inconsistent development effort behind Apple’s video apps. As speculated and rumored, progress was being held for a pro apps bundle, Creator Studio, but only sorta-kinda.</p>\n<p>It’s not the first time Apple has made a bundle for its pro creativity software. People may remember <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Cut_Studio\">Final Cut Studio</a>, which included Final Cut Pro, Motion, and Compressor (as well as other software). So Apple glued Logic Pro to that. Then they glued Pixelmator Pro to that. Then they said, “Do you know what’s just like these? (<em>Pregnant pause</em>.) Our productivity office applications.” and bundled those in as well, but <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2026/01/apples-pro-bundle-makes-sense-but-making-iwork-freemium-doesnt/\">only freemium beta features</a>. When I think of Final Cut Pro, I certainly think of “extra things I can do in Freeform.”</p>\n<p>While it’s positive that people who have paid for apps, or just like iWork, get to continue to use them, the way the features are partitioned between all of these versions makes very little sense, and will probably make even less sense over time. Take Pixelmator, which is supposed to be Apple’s answer to Photoshop. It will still be available to buy in the Mac App Store, but <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/pixelmator-pro/#:~:text=What%20is%20the,the%20App%C2%A0Store\">won’t have the new warp tool</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\">\n<img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/warp_tool-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Apple product page for Pixelmator Pro explaining the function of the warp tool. A curved outline is on a mug.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>\nThe only subscribers-only feature.<br>\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Sure, that’s the one thing in your Photoshop competitor that requires a subscription, the improved warp tool.</p>\n<p>Just one more thing…</p>\n<h2>What’s the deal with Photomator?</h2>\n<p>Pixelmator Pro received an update and an iPadOS app, but there are no updates for Photomator, a Lightroom analog, and it is not a part of the Creator Studio bundle. It continues to be a product that you can pay a <em>separate</em> subscription for on a monthly ($8), or yearly (<a href=\"https://duck.haus/@joesteel/115892120395858573\">there are three $30 a year plans, and one $40 a year plan, with no clear differences</a>) basis that offers nothing beyond bug fixes.</p>\n<p>It seems unlikely Apple is going to kill Photomator, because when Creator Studio was announced, Apple didn’t say anything about it—while it announced that Pixelmator Classic for iPhone wasn’t going to receive any updates.</p>\n<p>We’ll get back to Photomator. But first, let me explain how maddening that announcement about Pixelmator Classic was.</p>\n<p>Pixelmator Classic was the only Photoshop-like app on the iPhone that was truly Photoshop-like. Adobe’s own iPhone Photoshop apps (there have been many) have all been attempts at reimagining Photoshop for the iPhone, and seemingly aimed at customers who find Photoshop too intimidating. Unfortunately, its solution has just been less elegant than Pixelmator Classic’s.</p>\n<p>I pay Adobe for Creative Cloud and don’t use their Photoshop iPhone app. Instead, I use Pixelmator Classic, which is bizarrely being put out to pasture with no imminent or announced replacement. Maybe there will <em>eventually</em> be a Pixelmator for iPhone, and maybe that will <em>eventually</em> be in this Creator Studio bundle. There will simply be no way to know until, and unless, it happens. Apple loves its little surprises!</p>\n<p>Why not forecast that possibility by telling us what will happen with the multi-platform app Photomator? It’s the direct analog to Lightroom, making it the most obvious missing piece in Apple’s bundle. If it’s because there are no updates to announce for Photomator after over a year, then I would ask, “Why is Apple charging $30 a year for the existing version of Photomator?”</p>\n<p>If it’s because Photomator will instead be a $30 a year freemium unlock for the Photos app, then I would ask, “What’s the Creator Studio bundle for if it doesn’t include photography? <em>And</em> why is Apple still charging $30 a year?”</p>\n<p>Let’s say it’s going to make it a separate up-sell for Photos. Then we’ll probably find out in June, but it won’t ship until the fall. Conveniently, that gives me just enough time to start another yearly billing cycle for Photomator, so I will have paid $60 since Apple acquired Photomator and did nothing with it.</p>\n<p>I am <em>not</em> arguing that Photomator should be free. Free is unhealthy, because then there’s no motivation to improve the software. I’m arguing that if there’s a subscription fee I’m paying annually, then there needs to be at least annual development of the software. I don’t need massive updates, but I need some sign that there is, and will continue to be, value in paying an annual subscription.</p>\n<p>This isn’t software from a small, independent company any longer. It’s now software from Apple, which embarrassingly struggles to release its yearly OS updates for its platforms, and still can’t match its multi-platform apps feature for feature.</p>\n<p>There’s something very strange in Apple branding this as a Creator Studio, seemingly targeting independent “content” creators, but then not having a single iPhone app with a video, photo, illustration, image editing, or music specialization when the iPhone is the platform the creatives are the most concerned with as the final destination for their creativity.</p>\n<p>That just leads me back to the same conclusion that I drew in October: What is the promise Apple is making by asking for these annual payments? The mismatched nature of the bundle, and Apple’s spotty updates before this, makes me question if it thinks that just continuing things as they were, but with a subscription fee, is good enough.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I’m skeptical of the Creator Studio being a Creative Cloud replacement when Apple can’t even say what its answer to Lightroom is, when they bought their own answer to Lightroom over a year ago.</p>\n",

Map shows a dungeon room with characters and items.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>We took a break to get more snacks. I need to trim it out.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There was a time when QuickTime was <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2025/12/how-quicktime-survived-90s-apple-to-become-invisible-and-ubiquitous/\">more than just a playback utility</a>; I used it frequently to perform simple video edits, like removing commercials from an off-air recording or tacking the contents of one file on the end of another.</p>\n<p>Since those days ended with the deprecation of classic QuickTime, I’ve never really had a go-to utility for these kinds of trims. Sure, I can import the video into an editor and then re-export it, but that requires a second round of lossy encoding, which can make video look lousy. Better is to edit the already-compressed video itself. (This is what I use Rogue Amoeba’s excellent <a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/fission/\">Fission</a> to do with audio. Fission lets me edit an MP3 file without re-encoding it and adding a whole second layer of compression artifacts.)</p>\n<p>[<strong>Update</strong>: <em>Reader Michaël wrote in to point out, amazingly, that at some point years ago Apple added editing features back to QuickTime Player. If I knew about this, I forgot it. If you press Command-Y, you can split clips, and you can delete and re-order those clips. The issue is that the final file you save is a MOV container featuring those clips, which (I believe—tell me if I’m wrong, Michaël!) means that in the end you have to re-encode the video to get a seamless mp4 file for a video podcast.</em>]</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago after a <a href=\"https://www.theincomparable.com/tpk/\">Total Party Kill</a> session, I found myself once again needing to perform some trims to the “video bootleg” of the session. In the middle of the game, we took a ten-minute break, and I didn’t want viewers of the video to have to fast forward through 10 minutes of dead air.</p>\n<p>This time, I decided to look for a visual utility (i.e., not something I have to drive from Terminal) that could solve this problem. And I found it: the open-source app <a href=\"https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/blob/master/README.md\">LosslessCut</a>, which provides a nice interface atop the powerful FFmpeg command-line app.</p>\n<p>If I’m being honest, the app is not exactly intuitive, but there’s a bunch of documentation and after about five minutes I had learned every single keystroke required to do exactly what I wanted. The app let me cut segments out of the video, but it also supports rearranging segments, combining tracks, and an enormous set of other features I don’t care about, though you might.</p>\n<p>Since the app is open-source and on GitHub, you can get it for free, or you can <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1505323402\">get it on the Mac App Store</a> for $19 and support the work of developer Mikael Finstad, which is what I did.</p>\n",

      "link": "https://sixcolors.com/link/2026/01/gurman-details-apple-two-phase-ai-rollout/",
      "content": "<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman is back from some time off with a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/ios-27-apple-to-revamp-siri-as-built-in-iphone-mac-chatbot-to-fend-off-openai\">blockbuster report</a> about how Apple’s planning on rolling out its new Google-based AI models and functionality:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The previously promised, non-chatbot update to Siri — retaining the current interface — is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-12/apple-targets-spring-2026-for-release-of-delayed-siri-ai-upgrade\">planned for iOS 26.4</a>, due in the coming months. The idea behind that upgrade is to add features unveiled in 2024, including the ability to analyze on-screen content and tap into personal data. It also will be better at searching the web.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other words, Apple’s first plan is to make good on all of its broken AI promises from WWDC 2024, using a currently-available Google AI model. It’s an interesting decision, and suggests that Apple’s executives feel those promises hanging over their heads even now.</p>\n<p>Gurman continues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The chatbot capabilities will come later in the year, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. The company aims to unveil that technology in June at its Worldwide Developers Conference and release it in September.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The report says that iOS 27 will feature a newer Google-based model, and it will power Siri in both a voice and text-based chatbot mode. This just makes sense. But Gurman reports that Apple hasn’t committed to launching a full-fledged Siri app in the style of the Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT apps. This suggests that Apple may be reluctant to embrace the free-form prompt approach, which has its pros and cons. (I think having a place to refer to past chats and continue them is interesting; I also think that making a blank text box the primary interface for anything is a step backward, not forward.)</p>\n<p>One last tidbit from Gurman:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In a potential policy shift for Apple, the two partners are discussing hosting the chatbot directly on Google servers running powerful chips known as TPUs, or tensor processing units. The more immediate Siri update, in contrast, will operate on Apple’s own Private Cloud Compute servers, which rely on high-end Mac chips for processing.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I wonder what technical roadblocks are bringing an issue like this to the forefront. Can Apple’s carefully architected Private Cloud Compute infrastructure not provide enough power to run the Google-designed models they need? Will Google host that chatbot on hardware with similar privacy protections, or would this be a crack in Apple’s privacy approach? It will be interesting to see what Apple will do if forced to choose between privacy and functionality.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/ios-27-apple-to-revamp-siri-as-built-in-iphone-mac-chatbot-to-fend-off-openai\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2026/01/gurman-details-apple-two-phase-ai-rollout/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/apple-ai-pin/\">Via Juli Clover of MacRumors</a>, The Information <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-developing-ai-wearable-pin\">is reporting</a> that Apple is working on a “small, wearable AI pin with multiple cameras, a speaker, and microphones.” Clover’s summary:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The pin is said to be similar in size to an AirTag, with a thin, flat, circular disc shape. It has an aluminum and glass shell, and two cameras at the front. There is a standard lens and a wide-angle lens that are meant to capture photos and videos, while three microphones are designed to pick up sound around the wearer. An included speaker allows the pin to play audio, and there is a physical control button along one edge. The device is able to wirelessly charge like an Apple Watch.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a report about an early prototype, not a product being prepped in the supply chain, so if it ever exists, it’ll be quite a while from now—and there’s a good chance it’ll never exist.</p>\n<p>However, I think it’s interesting that Apple’s considering this product, because in many ways it fits with Apple’s product strategy. Sure, maybe in the future everyone will just wear AR glasses containing cameras and displays and audio output and an Internet connection. But it’s also possible that we’re headed for a more mix-and-match future with a constellation of smart devices that we wear in various contexts throughout our day. If you are someone who just has an iPhone in your pocket, it’s hidden away from the outside world… a problem rectified by wearing a small device with cameras and microphones on your shirt.</p>\n<p>Does such a device fit in the future, or would it be pointless and redundant? It’s hard to say right now, but it certainly seems like something worth an investigation by Apple. I’d be shocked if Apple’s long-term wearables strategy isn’t based on offering a load of ancillary devices that leverage the iPhone’s computing power and cellular connectivity wherever possible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/apple-ai-pin/\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2026/01/report-apple-developing-a-wearable-pin/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>",

And of course this article contains <strong>no spoilers</strong> for the book or any of Antony’s work.—J.S.</em>]</p>\n<p>I’m an author, primarily writing crime and thriller novels. I’m best known for the Cold War spy movie <em>Atomic Blonde</em>, which was based on my graphic novel. I also write the <em>Dog Sitter Detective</em> murder mysteries, the <em>Brigitte Sharp</em> spy thrillers, and most recently the interactive novel <em>Can You Solve the Murder?</em></p>\n<p>Hang on — an <em>interactive</em> novel? That’s right. You see, in addition to all the above, I also write video games. I grew up loving both books and games of all kinds, and was fortunate (read: old) enough to have been a young boy when the original <a href=\"https://www.cyoa.com\">Choose Your Own Adventure</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fightingfantasy.com\">Fighting Fantasy</a>, and <a href=\"https://projectaon.org/en/Main/Home\">Lone Wolf</a> books were first published.</p>\n<h2>Branching Out</h2>\n<p>Those series are examples of what came to be called ‘gamebooks’, because they’re both forms smushed into one; <em>books</em> where the reader plays an active part, directing the story by making choices, like playing a <em>game</em>. (These days we sometimes get fancy and call them ‘interactive novels’.) This is achieved by dividing the story into numbered sections and sending you to read different sections depending on your choices.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever played a text adventure game on a computer…</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fig1-lordsoftime-wikimedia-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of a text-based adventure game interface.

Commands like 'GET CASE,' 'OPEN DOOR,' and 'W' are listed for interaction.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>The ‘Lords of Time’ text adventure. (<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Screenshot_Lords_of_Time_(Level_9,_1983).jpg\">Wikimedia</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>…Then you’ve essentially played a gamebook, just with all the page-flipping done for you by the computer. The modern ‘Visual novel’ form is basically the same thing, too. </p>\n<p>We call these types of story a <em>branching narrative</em>, because the choice map often looks like a tree, with each new section branching off into further choices.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fig2-branching-example-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Flowchart with decision points and outcomes. Starts with 'Walk down the street,' branches into interactions with a dog, leading to choices like 'Give it a treat,' 'Walk on,' or 'Eat.' Ends with outcomes like 'Dog ignores you' or 'Mugger attacks.'\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Simplistic example of a branching narrative.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At their heart, all video games are essentially branching interactive experiences. You make a choice — whether in text, or with a joystick, or by pressing an action button — and something happens in the game reflecting that choice. The presentation of those choices, and the results, is nowadays enormously more sophisticated and complex than it was in a 1980s text adventure. But at their core, all games are about players making choices and the system reacting to them.</p>\n<p>Back in the late ’70s &amp; ’80s, computer games looked very much like that screenshot above. They weren’t the interactive movies with ultra-realistic graphics, hours of cinematic music, and dialogue voiced by professional actors to which we’ve become accustomed. Instead, they were basic, often poorly-written, and any graphics were extremely primitive. Those early limitations allowed gamebooks to thrive. They were almost always better-written than computer games, with richer and more evocative text, and were also often illustrated by professional artists.</p>\n<p>As video game technology accelerated, though, and digital interactive experiences became ever more realistic and immersive, gamebooks fell out of fashion. They became a curio, remembered with nostalgia by enthusiasts but largely forgotten by the mainstream.</p>\n<p>I was one of those enthusiasts from the very start. In fact, I was so taken with gamebooks that eleven-year-old me even had a go at creating one of my own, written on a manual typewriter and illustrated with a ballpoint pen, which I then made my friends play. Sadly, the ambitiously-titled <em>Hellfire of Death’s Caverns</em> is lost to the mists of time, but looking back, it certainly explains a lot about my career.</p>\n<p>You see, a love of gamebooks introduced me to early role-playing games and fantasy board games, which in turn led to an interest in game design… which ultimately led to me working in videogames as a writer and narrative designer. That career has run in parallel with my fiction writing for the past twenty years<sup id=\"fnref-38145-fn2\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38145-fn2\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup>, and more recently I’ve also established myself as an award-winning crime author.</p>\n<h2>Charting a Course</h2>\n<p>I love writing and plotting crime and mystery fiction. I love writing and designing games. So I kept wondering: was there some way to combine the two? </p>\n<p>That’s when I remembered the many hours I spent as a boy with my head buried in gamebooks. Was it possible to write a crime story in that format? How would I handle clues, red herrings, and all the other elements that people love about murder mysteries? </p>\n<p>And how on earth do you plan a book like that, anyway?</p>\n<p>While answers to many of those questions would take months of work to figure out, the last — how do you plan a gamebook? — was one to which I already knew the answer thanks to that early typewritten effort, and my later experience in game design: you build a huge flowchart.</p>\n<p>The original gamebook authors drew their charts and maps by hand, on taped-together pieces of paper, with markers. If you’ve ever mapped a text adventure game in a notebook as you played, you were effectively doing the same thing in reverse.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, though, we have better tools. Digital tools. Surely one of them would be better suited to making such a flowchart. But which one?</p>\n<p>There are quite a few apps and services out there with which to build flowcharts. I was already familiar with <a href=\"https://miro.com/\">Miro</a>, an online service used by many game designers for brainstorming and building ‘paper prototypes’ (while there’s no paper involved these days, the name has stuck). I used Miro to plan a couple of proof-of-concept interactive short stories, which I wrote to get a handle on the format and test whether I could make it work.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fig3-story-flowchart-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"A complex flowchart with yellow, blue, and green boxes connected by lines, containing text. Red dots mark specific nodes. The chart branches extensively, indicating multiple pathways and decisions.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>A flowchart for a branching narrative short story. That tangle in the bottom left shows why fine-tuned control over directional arrows is essential.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I could, and friends to whom I sent the prototypes enjoyed them, so I began planning a book-length mystery.</p>\n<p>But Miro is a subscription service, with only a small number of ‘boards’ available to free accounts. I was already at my limit, and reluctant to subscribe — believe me when I tell you that very few authors actually make a living writing novels! So I put aside the decision of what to use for a moment and focused on pitching the book itself. After all, if it didn’t sell, there’d be no need to build charts.</p>\n<p>I needn’t have worried. <em><a href=\"https://antonyjohnston.com/work/books/index.php#cystm\">Can You Solve the Murder?</a><sup id=\"fnref-38145-fn3\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38145-fn3\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">2</a></sup></em> went to a bidding war, and was eventually acquired by Transworld in a two-book deal with a frighteningly short deadline. The matter of choosing a flowcharting tool had now become rather urgent.</p>\n<p>My criteria were simple, but specific. I wanted to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lay out the chart in a freeform manner, rather than being forced into a grid, with no limit on size or dimensions\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>But have the option to snap-align objects to one another</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Draw arrows that snap to destination objects with auto-applied directional heads, <em>and</em> that can be moved and modified freely later</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Easily apply text labels to arrows that represent a choice (most do, but not all) and have those labels move with the arrows when modified</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Draw multiple such arrows coming from a single object</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have multiple arrows also arriving <em>at</em> a single object</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mix object shapes, and be able to easily resize and re-color them however I wish</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Write text directly into any object, and have the text be easy to modify: size, color, style, etc</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Overlay shapes on top of one another (in order to track section numbers and clues discovered)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, I needed it to feel intuitive and simple to use. While that’s not really a quantifiable metric, it was important to me. I knew I’d be spending many, many hours making and using these charts. As a former graphic designer, not to mention lifelong Mac user, I want my tools to get out of the way and let me work, not make me wrestle them into submission.</p>\n<p>I spent the next couple of weeks trialling many different charting apps and web services. I won’t go into detail on them, but suffice to say that while several had the features I was looking for, none of them felt particularly easy or intuitive to use… </p>\n<h2>Return to #1 and Try Again</h2>\n<p>…Except Miro, to which I kept returning. So I sucked it up and used part of my book advance to pay for a subscription.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the best tool had to win out. I’m a big believer that using inferior tools simply isn’t worth the hassle and frustration they cause, no matter how cheap they may be, and while Miro still isn’t perfect (it doesn’t do per-character text sizing, and object color modification could be better), it remains the tool best suited to how I build gamebook flowcharts. In some ways, using Miro reminds me of a good vector design app, like the venerable Aldus FreeHand<sup id=\"fnref-38145-fn4\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38145-fn4\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">3</a></sup> or modern Affinity Designer, with an ease to its interface and UI that at times becomes almost invisible (the highest compliment I can pay an interface).</p>\n<p>So, how do I use all those features I mentioned to build a gamebook flowchart? Well, let’s take a look.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fig4-flowchart-legend-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"A complex flowchart with yellow, blue, and black boxes connected by lines, featuring text and icons. It branches into multiple paths, indicating decision points and processes.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Only five colors, sorry.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Colors</strong>: Green boxes represent ‘core story’ sections, which all readers will see, while yellow boxes are sections that will only be seen by readers who make particular choices. Blue boxes are ‘ghost’ sections — they don’t exist in the book, but here they note where a choice will send you to a different part of the chart. Dark green boxes are good endings, while black boxes are — you guessed it — bad endings that require you to return to #1 and try again.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fig2-branching-example-big-scaled.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Flowchart with decision points and outcomes.

Ends with outcomes like 'Dog ignores you' or 'Mugger attacks.'\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Pet the dog, be rewarded. If only real life were so simple.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Overlaid objects</strong>: Each main colored box has a numbered red circle overlaid on it at top-right — this is the number of that section in the book, to which you flip when directed. Some boxes also have a blue circle bottom-right for Clue Numbers, which I’ll explain below.</p>\n<p><strong>Text inside any object</strong>: In addition to text in the main boxes, the number codes in those red and blue circles are contained directly within the object, rather than being a separate text box placed on top and grouped. This sounds like a small thing, but it makes them much easier to manipulate, edit, and move around the board, and when you’re dealing with literally hundreds of these objects, it makes a big difference.</p>\n<p><strong>Grid alignment</strong>: Although most of the boxes are aligned with one another by choice, note that section #52 is not. This tangle demonstrates the value of not being forced into a grid:</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tangle-even-closer-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"A flowchart with yellow boxes for decisions and actions, blue box for 'Get to safety,' and black arrows connecting them. Includes text like 'Lock yourself in,' 'Smash window,' and 'Call boss.' Some boxes have question marks.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Freeform arrows</strong>: Many boxes have multiple arrows branching out of them, and #46 even has multiple arrows branching <em>into</em> it. That’s an essential requirement. Again, that tangle reinforces the need for fine control over arrows.</p>\n<p><strong>Arrow labels</strong>: These show which section a choice (or conditional: see below) directs you to read next.</p>\n<p>The blue circles are part of a system I call Clue Numbers. Many sections of <em>Can You Solve the Murder?</em> ask the reader to write down a Clue Number. In this example, the text of section #23 would end with the instruction:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Write down <strong>D2</strong> in your notebook, then turn to <strong>#46</strong>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Later, if you decide to keep walking and thus turn to section #9, a <em>conditional</em> check is made. The text of that scene would end as follows: </p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  If you have D2 written in your notebook, turn to <strong>#32</strong></p>\n<p>  Otherwise, turn to <strong>#58</strong>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This mechanic is vital to the success of a clue-based mystery like <em>Can You Solve the Murder?</em> because it effectively allows the book to ‘remember’ your choices, and the information you’ve gathered, throughout the story — but does so in a way that doesn’t give the game away, because the reader doesn’t know what those codes mean. (I do, of course, and track them all in a spreadsheet). </p>\n<p>It’s impossible to complete <em>Can You Solve the Murder?</em> without using Clue Numbers. Thus, it’s vital that I can easily assign them to the appropriate sections and move them around if need be when building the book’s flowchart.</p>\n<h2>Sharing the Load</h2>\n<p>One nice element of using an online service is shareability. This was necessary for <em>Can You Solve the Murder?</em> because of something called ‘structural edits’. In fiction writing, this is what happens after you submit your first draft, and the editor then suggests changes such as removing/adding subplots, modifying characters, perhaps re-ordering some scenes, and so on. All these things change the <em>structure</em> of the book, hence the term.</p>\n<p>Making such large-scale changes to a gamebook manuscript would be absolute hell.</p>\n<p>Every choice in a branching narrative sets off a cascade of subsequent choices and reactions, meaning structural changes ripple downstream throughout the book. In a regular novel, revising a manuscript to remove a secondary character can often be accomplished fairly easily. In a gamebook, though, it might require re-plotting half the story, creating new sections, re-ordering existing paths… a nightmare that could take weeks or even months to untangle.</p>\n<p>To avoid this, I gave my editors password-protected view-only access to the flowchart board, something Miro makes very easy (I could also have given them full editing access, or not required a password), and asked them to make their structural edit notes <em>based on the flowchart</em>. None of us had ever worked on a book like this before, and doing so required a lot of mutual trust, especially with strange requests like this! But it worked out, and part of that was down to how easy Miro makes sharing and viewing.</p>\n<p>You can also easily export a Miro board, or part of one, to a variety of formats, including JPG, PDF, and even CSV. While I haven’t needed that facility for <em>Can You Solve the Murder?</em>, I use it often in my video game work.</p>\n<p>The truth is that I barely use a fraction of Miro’s power. There are Miro wizards out there who can make it do all sorts of things: presentations, prototypes, slideshows, you name it. I’ve worked with some of them at game studios. Apparently, even the NFL’s digital team uses it to plan gameday strategy for their apps and services. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@MiroHQ\">Miro’s YouTube channel</a> has many such case studies, along with tutorials.</p>\n<p>Me? I don’t need to do any of those things, and wouldn’t know where to start. But that leads me to the final thing I like about Miro: it doesn’t force that stuff on me. </p>\n<p>One of my favorite and most-used apps is the writing software <a href=\"https://www.literatureandlatte.com\">Scrivener</a>, which I’ve used since it first launched in 2007. (I’m writing this very article in it.) A common refrain amongst its advocates is that most people only use 20% of Scrivener’s features… but we all use a <em>different</em> 20%. Miro feels very much the same.<sup id=\"fnref-38145-fn5\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38145-fn5\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">4</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Choose Your Own Learning</h2>\n<p>I expect most of you reading this aren’t writing interactive novels. But you might need to create charts or diagrams of some kind, and if so, I recommend Miro. Yes, there are free alternatives out there, but I haven’t found any that are as flexible and intuitive to use.</p>\n<p>As for the book, <em>Can You Solve the Murder?</em> was published in summer 2025 and quickly became my best-selling novel ever. A sequel, <em>The Forest of Death</em>, is due this year… and yes, I used Miro again to build its flowchart.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-38145-fn2\">\nMy first game was the original <em>Dead Space</em>, on which I started work in 2006. Since then, I’ve written titles like <em>Resident Evil Village, Dead Space Extraction</em>, <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>, <em>CSR Racing</em> (which was featured in an Apple keynote!), <em>Binary Domain</em>, and many more. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-38145-fn2\" title=\"Return to main content.\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-38145-fn3\">\nAs part of promoting the book, I also designed an interactive live event in which the audience must solve a (different) murder.

But Twine’s interface is often frustrating and slow, and it wouldn’t allow me to do even half of the things I set out in my criteria list. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-38145-fn5\" title=\"Return to main content.\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

Plug it in, configure, and (one hopes) forget about it until you need to retrieve a file or restore a volume. While hard disk drives don’t last forever, they keep ticking away for years and years before—often suddenly—giving up the ghost.<sup id=\"fnref-38088-power\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38088-power\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>At some point, all Time Capsule owners will need to face the problem, even if they’re not planning to update to macOS 27 El Cerrito (or whatever it’s called).

While you could add an external drive, that seemed to defeat the point of a standalone unit, particularly when you remember the port was USB 2.0 or 480 Mbps, far below internal hard drive rates.<sup id=\"fnref-38088-extremedrive\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38088-extremedrive\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we didn’t have better options when the Time Capsule came out, and for years afterwards. Internet-hosted backups are a good supplement, but I don’t think there’s a drop-in replacement that boasts the same ease, even if reliability were not an issue.</p>\n<h2>Replace the Time Capsule</h2>\n<p>What can you do today to replace a Time Capsule and provide the functionality it offered? You have effectively three choices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a drive (or drives) to a desktop Mac.</li>\n<li>Install a NAS that supports the features required for Time Machine.</li>\n<li>Use a third-party tool that is tweakier than Time Machine, but may fit the bill better.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Time Machine’s key attributes are that you can set it and forget it, that it prunes older backups over time without intervention, and that it’s integrated into macOS for easy (by some definitions) retrievals of older versions of files and deleted files.<sup id=\"fnref-38088-deleted\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38088-deleted\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>I have a desktop Mac, and use cloning software to make a nightly duplicate of my startup volume and Backblaze for Internet-based encrypted backups. Most of my documents are on Dropbox or iCloud Drive, so I felt I had sufficient redundancy. I balked at using Time Machine, as it was so fiddly and unreliable for a long time, requiring erasing external drives or poking at low-level settings.</p>\n<p>The other issue was how inefficiently Time Machine interacted with hard drives. During active backups, whatever CPU management Apple said was in place, my computer would be affected, and I’d also have to hear the whirs and whines of active drives.</p>\n<p>At some point (I’d say about four or five years ago), Time Machine improved in quality, and solid-state drives started to drop in price for compact 1 TB USB 3.x models, which could connect at 5 to 10 Gbps; later 2 TB SSDs dropped in price enough to fit my budget, too. I’m embarrassed to show a photo, but here are three of the five SSDs connected to my Mac: four are 2 TB, and one is a dual 4 TB RAID 0 configuration that gives me an 8 TB volume.<sup id=\"fnref-38088-raid\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38088-raid\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">5</a></sup> Two others are plugged in elsewhere!</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/glenn-ssd-shame-1380px.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"A wooden table with a Thunderbolt hub and three SSD drives connected with messy cables\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Affordable 2 TB SSDs enabled me to have reliable, fast Time Machine backups and not waste time on HDD failures.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Using an SSD plugged directly into a Mac could be a solution. Even if you don’t have a desktop Mac, plugging in an SSD on a regular basis when you’re using the laptop on a desk or other location is feasible, too: Time Machine automatically picks up when an associated volume is mounted.</p>\n<p>The improvement I saw in Time Machine and the switch to SSDs made it feasible for a desktop Mac to serve as the networked destination for four family laptops, including mine. So I didn’t go down the NAS path. There are inexpensive NAS options that can be remotely administered, if you’re helping a relative or need remote access, and support the protocols needed for Time Machine. Synology <a href=\"https://kb.synology.com/en-us/DSM/tutorial/How_to_back_up_files_from_Mac_to_Synology_NAS_with_Time_Machine\">has a tech-support note</a> on using Time Machine with its devices. And I recommend looking at Tailscale for ensuring you can always tunnel in; the company also <a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1307/nas\">has NAS support</a>. (See <a href=\"https://tidbits.com/2025/02/24/tailscale-gives-you-remote-access-to-your-lan-from-anywhere/\">my long background look at Tailscale</a> at TidBITS, and a <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/09/solution-to-a-jeopardy-streaming-conundrum-what-is-tailscale/\">specific usage case</a> here at Six Colors.)</p>\n<p>You might also look into third-party tools that perform various kinds of cloning and archiving operations, though you need an external drive, a networked Mac with an accessible drive, or a NAS to make use of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bombich.com\">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> remains the best option for cloning, with some archiving options. (<a href=\"https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html\">SuperDuper</a> is a long-time favorite, but its Tahoe support remains in beta, according to its Website.)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.arqbackup.com\">Arq</a> and <a href=\"https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html?srsltid=AfmBOopXMEedjRxwabhl6afUDoJTeQ0PTdDx5bgJjVDxGj1a5O3CM2Qq\">ChronoSync</a> each provide exhaustive options for scheduled cloning and archiving, but have a learning curve that can be steep depending on your precise backup goal. They’re not drop-in Time Machine replacements, but can be configured to an approximation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of those apps offer flexibility in backup destinations. I’ve used ChronoSync to archive files on one of my virtual Linux servers over SFTP to my Mac, for instance. And you could archive critical files with encryption on cloud-storage systems, too.</p>\n<p>I do wish someone would release a Time Capsule successor that was nearly single-purpose and had two or four slots for NVMe M.2 format SSDs. Rather than a highly configurable NAS, just give us something that plugs and goes—and can be upgraded and repaired!</p>\n<h2>For further reading</h2>\n<p>Take Control publisher Joe Kissell offers a deep dive into Mac backups that can help you find and execute the right strategy in <em><a href=\"https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/backing-up/?pt=6COLORS\">Take Control of Backing Up Your Mac</a></em>.

Like, <em>seriously</em> tiny—so small that it comes with a stick-on magnet ring and will <em>just</em> snuggle into the MagSafe area on an iPhone 17 Pro Max.</p>\n<p>The moment I saw that the Xteink X4 didn’t have any lighting, I decided I wasn’t going to bother—I spent way too much time clipping book lights to Kindles so I could read in the dark. But in a moment of weakness (possibly fueled by several Hazy IPAs and high altitude) over Thanksgiving, I bought one. It was $69! Why not take a chance on a weird little e-reader?</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/xteink-tall-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"A person holding a black e-reader displaying text from a book.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Third-party firmware makes the Xteink X4 usable.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When the Xteink X4 arrived, I got my answer: I was <em>deeply</em> unimpressed with the hardware, which has two rocker switches on the front as well as a rocker on the side <em>and</em> a power button <em>and</em> a recessed reset button. Look, I love e-reader buttons, but eight is too many. Of course, there was the aforementioned lack of lighting, meaning you need to use it outside or in a well-lit room. Also, the whole <em>premise</em> of this thing seems to have been that it sticks on the back of your iPhone, but that’s not true unless you have absolutely the largest iPhone available.</p>\n<p>But I’ll give it this: it was tiny.</p>\n<p>The software was the real tragedy, though: It was really bad. Hard to navigate (so many buttons) and, tragically, just bad at being an e-reader. I couldn’t turn off forced justification, another deal-breaker for me. I tossed it on my desk and figured I wouldn’t write about it because why kick this little thing when it’s down? (I did say some unkind things about it <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/596\">on Upgrade</a>, I’ll admit.)</p>\n<p>And then a funny thing happened: Dan Moren sent me a message saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Finally got my Xteink ironically after hearing you slag it on Upgrade. So I flashed it with the community-made firmware, which by all accounts is better.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I had seen several people report that the Xteink worked better with some community-built firmware, but I hadn’t tried it—mostly because I firmly believe that suggesting that someone buy hardware only to immediately replace its firmware with someone else’s fix is not really the endorsement it sounds like.<sup id=\"fnref-38079-miyoo\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38079-miyoo\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>But Dan’s message intrigued me, moreso when he pointed out that I could install the new firmware <a href=\"https://xteink.dve.al\">directly from a web page using Chrome</a>. Loading a web page and clicking a button seemed like a very low-effort way to see what all the fuss is about, so I went ahead and installed <a href=\"https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader\">CrossPoint reader</a>.</p>\n<p>What a difference. The CrossPoint software draws labels next to the four rocker directions on the front of the Xteink x4, so you know what each button does. It parses ePub files properly, offers font and justification control, and will even display the cover art of the book you’re reading. There’s even support for uploading books via Wi-Fi!</p>\n<p>Is it as sophisticated as other e-readers? Absolutely not. Most readers are either Android or Android-based; the Xteink X4 is an ESP32-based thing, so it’s <em>incredibly</em> bare bones. But it works.</p>\n<p>Do I recommend that people rush out and get the Xteink X4? No, I don’t. It’s fun to mess around with, and if you’re looking for a super-tiny e-reader that you can keep in a pocket or bag and break out in well-lit spaces at the drop of a hat, it will suffice. It won’t sync with other readers or your phone, so consider it the digital equivalent of throwing a paperback in your purse or backpack.</p>\n<p>What I am enthusiastic about is the potential for interesting e-readers. Amazon seems comfortable shipping Paperwhites that are <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/11/2024-kindle-colorsoft-and-paperwhite-review-no-perfect-choices/\">boring and featureless</a>, Kobo’s innovation seems to have slowed as well, and everyone seems distracted by the possibility of finding a new market with E Ink-based note-taking devices like <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/01/kindle-scribe-review-big-beautiful-and-buttonless/\">the Kindle Scribe</a>.</p>\n<p>But there’s still room for weird. The Android-based <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/boox-palma-review-a-phone-shaped-e-reader/\">Boox Palma</a> is shaped like a phone, but it’s an e-reader. At $250, it’s not cheap, and it’s a bit too big, but who’s to say where experimentation with smartphone marks and E Ink screens might lead? And coming from the bottom up are devices like the Xteink X4, with basic software running on ESP32 hardware.</p>\n<p>If I were Xteink or any similar hardware developer, I’d be looking hard at giving support to the CrossPoint project and then focusing my efforts on making a device with simpler controls (fewer buttons!). Adding lighting and potentially a touchscreen would make this interesting, too. There are a lot of directions this sort of product could go—so let’s get to experimenting.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I’ve loaded a bunch of DRM-free public domain books from <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org\">Standard Ebooks</a> on my Xteink X4 and am letting it just hang around the house. I can pick up <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/agatha-christie/the-murder-at-the-vicarage\">an Agatha Christie</a> on a sunny afternoon and just enjoy a little bit of reading time. There’s a lot of potential here.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-38079-miyoo\">\nTo be fair, I bought a <a href=\"https://www.miyoogame.com/product/miyoo-mini-plus-retro-handheld-game-console/\">Miyoo Mini Plus</a> retro game handheld and immediately installed <a href=\"https://onionui.github.io/docs/installation\">Onion OS</a> on it on <a href=\"https://wavelengths.online/posts/the-two-best-entry-level-handhelds-are-on-sale\">Brendon Bigley’s recommendation</a>, and that worked well. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-38079-miyoo\" title=\"Return to main content.\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

But you’ll note I said “largely.” There are still a few things that I use 1Password for and while Apple is generally good about ticking off the lowest hanging fruit and leaving third parties to offer more niche products, I’d argue that authentication and security are important enough to our everyday lives that the Passwords app can afford to take on more responsibility.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SSHKeySettings-6c.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of a settings window titled 'Keys' with options to sync SSH keys and synchronize keys via iCloud Keychain.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Edovia’s Screens can use SSH keys to simplify logging into a remote computer.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>So, maybe it’s time for a power user feature. <em>cracks knuckles</em> SSH keys!

Like passkeys, SSH keys are credentials that rely on public-key cryptography to simplify connecting to remote servers and computers without the use of passwords.</p>\n<p>And before you dismiss this as something that’s just for those of us who enjoy diving into Terminal, lots of services and sites let you use SSH keys, from GitHub to apps like Edovia’s screen-sharing app Screens and many more.

In part because they can be stored or viewed in many places: in your user’s home directory on macOS, synced via iCloud Keychain, in macOS’s Keychain Access app, the command-line <code>ssh-agent</code> tool, and even some third-party apps like, yes, 1Password can handle them.<sup id=\"fnref-38071-1password\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38071-1password\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>A veritable surfeit of solutions. Too many, really. I’d love to be able to have all my keys stored in a user-friendly interface like Passwords, which would hopefully work under the hood with the command-line tools as well as providing a system for more easily using the keys. 1Password seems to provide the best implementation here, where you can set it up to have requests for your key pop up a dialog box where you can use biometrics or your main password to authenticate.</p>\n<p>Just as Apple eventually supported (or at least didn’t actively <em>hinder</em>) <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/08/in-macos-sonoma-touch-id-for-sudo-can-survive-updates/\">Touch ID for <code>sudo</code> on the command line</a>, it’d be great to see Passwords embrace SSH key management for those of us who need it.

We live in a world where Adobe’s Creative Suite and Microsoft Office have been subscription plays for more than a decade. When <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2024/11/apple-buys-pixelmator/\">Apple bought Pixelmator</a> in 2024, it seemed like Apple really was building its own take on the Creative suite, and later this month it’ll finally arrive.</p>\n<p>At $129 a year, it’s a lot cheaper than Adobe’s Creative Cloud subscription and roughly what I pay for just Photoshop and Lightroom… but it’s obviously more expensive than Canva’s Affinity suite, which threatens a new business model of “free software, but pay for AI features.” Still, I’m old enough to remember when Logic and Final Cut cost many, many hundreds of dollars—putting them entirely out of the reach of most people. Now you can just spend $13 for a month in Final Cut or Logic to work on a project or even see if it’s the right tool for you. I think that’s a pretty good deal.</p>\n<p>Truth be told, Final Cut and Logic are among Apple’s two most updated apps. I’ve been using them both for ages, and there are always new updates with new features—and I’ve very rarely been asked to pay for an upgrade. (The Logic Pro release notes <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-afri/109503\">are a sight to behold</a>.) When a developer is committed to consistently improving its subscription product, I think it’s a fair exchange that benefits customer and developer alike.</p>\n<p>The addition of Pixelmator also gives Apple a piece it was missing before. Pixemator combines many features found in Photoshop and Illustrator, giving Apple the design tool that it was missing previously. It’s hard for me not to look at this bundle and think that, for the people it’s designed to serve, it’s a pretty compelling offering.</p>\n<p>But something about this announcement really doesn’t sit right with me.</p>\n<p>Apple has chosen to roll its “iWork” apps—Numbers, Keynote, Pages, and Freeform—into this bundle. While the company has gone out of its way to assure everyone that those apps, which come free when you buy Apple hardware, will remain free… it’s also essentially converting them into “freemium” apps that have features that will only be unlocked if you pay $129 a year for the Creator Studio.</p>\n<p>Some of the additional items do make sense as subscription offerings. Apple is offering loads of templates and themes for those apps, limited to subscribers. It’s not unreasonable to ask for money in order to access a content library, and the templates and themes seem geared at the target audience for the bundle: creators.</p>\n<p>But it’s some of the other stuff that gives me pause. Apple is adding <em>features</em> to the iWork apps, and locking them behind a paywall. There’s a feature that generates a Keynote presentation from a text outline, and another that creates presenter notes from an existing slide deck. Users of Numbers will be able to have access to Magic Fill, which lets them “generate formulas and fill in tables based on pattern recognition.”</p>\n<p>On the one hand, these read like they’re AI-powered features that might have actual costs attached to them. But they still don’t seem like features designed for the creative customers targeted by the bundle. They seem like regular features of Keynote and Numbers, ones that those apps’ much more general user base might want… but rather than being broadly released, they’re being withheld.</p>\n<p>I don’t generally like the idea that Apple’s taking the free software that has added to the value of its premium hardware for a couple of decades and turning it into an upsell designed to generate more services revenue. But at least I can understand that if there’s an actual cost to running AI-powered functionality, giving it away entirely for free might not be a wise thing to do.</p>\n<p>More specifically, this move stinks for anyone who uses Keynote and Numbers and <em>isn’t</em> in the target audience of Pixelmator, Final Cut, and Logic users. If Apple wanted to offer an iWork subscription for $20 a year that enabled AI features, some nice templates, and the rest, I’d… probably still complain.</p>\n<p>It junks up the simplicity of the classic iWork concept: Apple devices come, for free, with a suite of software tools that let you get things done. Even though Apple has taken great pains to say that the iWork apps will remain free, they’re now free with an asterisk: free except for the stuff you have to pay for. Asterisks make things less simple.</p>\n<p>But at least if Apple chose to offer iWork users a targeted bundle, it would be something understandable and reasonable. This, though? A feature to make building formulas and tables in Numbers is, somehow, limited to people paying $129 a year for Final Cut? A feature to make it easier for someone to build a Keynote presentation out of their notes is only available for someone shelling out $129 for Logic or Pixelmator?</p>\n<p>It just doesn’t make sense. It’s as if Apple has decided that there can only be one Apple software bundle, and all of its apps are just going to be dumped into it. And I’m worried about where this potentially might lead, in terms of making the entire Mac, iPad, and iPhone buying experience <a href=\"https://craphound.com/category/enshittification/\">feel more exploitative and gross</a>. Apple needs to recognize that it’s in the business of selling high-margin hardware that people buy <em>because it’s nice</em>. The more that an expensive phone or computer is just an upsell opportunity for the <em>real</em> thing that requires an annual fee, the less special it is.</p>\n<p>I understand charging an annual fee for great professional audio, video, and design tools. But for features in a free bundled spreadsheet app? It just doesn’t pass the sniff test.</p>\n",

On Tuesday, the company <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/introducing-apple-creator-studio-an-inspiring-collection-of-creative-apps/\">announced its Apple Creator Studio subscription bundle</a>, including Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Compressor, and MainStage as well as additional features for productivity apps Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform. The bundle will be available starting on January 28.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the top line news: the subscription, which is a universal purchase across Apple’s platforms, is sharable across up to six members of an Apple family and will cost $12.99 per month or $129 for a year, with a one-month free trial. There’s also a substantial education discount for the bundle: $2.99 per month or just $29.99 per year. Additionally, customers purchasing a new Mac or a specific model of iPad<sup id=\"fnref-38053-specs\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38053-specs\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup> will be able to get three months of the bundle for free.</p>\n<p>You can also continue to buy the <em>Mac</em> versions of any these apps as an individual one-time purchase. The productivity apps themselves will stay free—subscribing to the bundle will only unlock additional features for that software.</p>\n<p>All the pro apps gain new features as part of this update. Final Cut Pro gets Transcription Search to search through footage and find the right piece of audio; Beat Detection, which lets you time videos to beats in music; and Montage Maker, which uses AI to edit together a dynamic video where you can adjust the settings.</p>\n<p>Logic Pro gains a Synth Player for its AI Session Players; Chord ID, which can turn audio into a chord progression; and a new Sound Library. The iPad version also gets the Mac version’s Quick Swipe Comping feature as well as Music Understanding functionality that helps you find a loop by using natural language to describe it.</p>\n<p>Pixelmator Pro is perhaps the biggest part of this announcement, as many have wondered what was in store for the graphics app after <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2024/11/apple-buys-pixelmator/\">its parent company’s acquisition by Apple in late 2024</a>. The Mac app comes to the iPad for the first time with Apple Pencil support, and there’s a new Warp tool across all versions.</p>\n<p>As for the productivity apps, the Apple Creator Studio adds a Content Hub for what Apple describes as “curated, high-quality photos, graphics, and illustrations.” There are also new premium templates and themes for Keynote, Pages, and Numbers and integration with image-generation tools from OpenAI. Apple is also, in an unusual move, including beta features as part of the bundle: the company mentions one that can create a draft of a Keynote presentation from a text outline and one called “Magic Fill” for Numbers with lets you “generate formulas and fill in tables based on pattern recognition.” Freeform’s premium features aren’t yet ready to roll out but will come later this year.</p>\n<p>Overall, this ground is well trod. Other companies like Adobe and Affinity have offered creative bundles of their software suites, and recurring subscription revenue is an attractive prospect for the company.</p>\n<p>I’m glad that Apple is retaining the individual purchase option for the Mac apps: if you’re a pro who really only needs a single app, an individual purchase seems to make more sense. Any more than that, and you might be better off with the subscription—as long, of course, as you don’t mind paying in perpetuity.</p>\n<p>I do wonder a bit about those who’d prefer to have the iPad apps as individual purchases, but I’d speculate that Apple has probably looked at what customers’ buying habits on that platform and see this as a way to juice adoption there.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-38053-specs\">\nAny model capable of running Apple Intelligence, it seems: an A16, A17 Pro, or M-series chip or later and at least 6GB of RAM. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-38053-specs\" title=\"Return to main content.\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

(The cheapest starting list price for a current Mac at the moment is the $599 Mac mini.)

Is it 15%, 26%, 55%, or far more? We don’t know. But it appears to be far less adoption this far out than updates to iOS 18 a year ago. Blame Liquid Glass, or user exhaustion, or the amount of unused storage required.</p>\n<p>The practical combination is that tools introduced in the 26 releases for Phone and Messages, particularly useful on an iPhone, are either not being used or could be used better.</p>\n<p>Apple stepped up to the plate on overhauling and improving the way that unwanted and full-on spam messages are identified and categorized, and can be blocked. Let’s look at how you could configure your phone—and that of people you love—to better lock out the creepo fraudsters.</p>\n<h2>Take a look at updated Phone settings</h2>\n<p>In that <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/05/business/medicare-scam-calls.html\">Medicare scam article</a>, one senior explained to the reporter why he answers every call:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  His family can’t set the phone to allow calls only from preapproved numbers, because that would filter out some medical calls. And changing his phone number seems unfeasible, given that every legitimate contact would have to be notified.</p>\n<p>  “I’m counting the days until open enrollment ends,” Ms. Kurutz said.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>With iOS 26, there’s a lot more that can be done, even by a user who isn’t a smartphone expert. Most of the actions that can be taken are as complex as answering a call or not much more so. The benefits of acting on them should be enough to reinforce behavior.</p>\n<p>The most incredible thing you can enable for yourself or someone else right away is the Screen Unknown Callers feature in the Settings app in Apps: Phone. To balance the need to get calls from unknown parties while also avoiding fraud, enable Ask Reason for Calling. Now, any incoming call that isn’t from a number in contacts requires the calling party to provide a little information, which is automatically transcribed and can be viewed in real time.</p>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/phone-screen-live-screen-sbs.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of Call Screening shown side by side: left, the screened conversation as it occurred in real time; right, the transcribed screening message in Voicemail\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Using call screening ensures you don’t have to pick up for bozos.</figcaption></figure>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/screen-unknown-callers-26.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of iPhone Screen Unknown Callers settings\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Set to Ask Reason for Calling for real-time, automated screening that can weed out scumbags (and time wasters).</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If it’s a scammer, it’s easy enough to tap Stop or just ignore. Any legitimate party will say who they are. Later, you can select the call and tap Report Spam. While some fraudsters rotate through numbers like mad, I think some industry and governmental measures in the United States to reduce the ability to fake incoming phone numbers have worked: If I don’t block a number immediately, I will often see calls from it over time until I do. I also find that looking up a number via a search engine leads me to a page with a huge number of spam reports, meaning that number should be blocked in any case.</p>\n<p>People <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/glennf.com\">unfortunate enough to follow me on Bluesky</a> know that I needed a lot of medical care in 2025—things are going great now!—and I enabled this iOS 26 feature in the summer on a beta release. I constantly had calls coming from healthcare workers, and the filtering feature meant I answered all of those (and then marked them as known callers), and was able to avoid dozens of others.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/call-filtering-26.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of iPhone Call Filtering settings\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Call Filtering may move some calls out of sight if Unknown Callers is on, though it’s quite useful when you aren’t expected calls from unknown numbers, like medical staff.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Because of the possible need to receive calls from unknown numbers, as above, you may want to leave Phone settings for Call Filtering: Unknown Callers turned off. If you don’t, then a screened or missed call from such a number requires tapping the Filter menu and choosing Unknown Callers to review it. At least a red dot appears over the Filter icon when there are messages in Unknown Callers or Spam to give a cue.</p>\n<p>The other option in this section, Spam, should be turned on. It lets you rely on a carrier’s analysis from phone network traffic of call patterns or customer reports of spam. I also recommend installing the free version of the apps from AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon that let you enable spam detection at the network level—that can block some calls even before they reach your phone.</p>\n<p>The Call Blocking &amp; Identification option is yet another way to amp up your iPhone’s intelligence about calls you (or a loved one) doesn’t want. Services from companies like <a href=\"https://www.hiya.com/products/apps/hiya-spam-blocker\">Hiya</a> receive spam reports constantly, and push out updates to a list that’s resident on your device that allows instant matching for potential or well-known spam numbers. Enabling one of these apps lets calls that pass through other layers of filtering display a label identifying a call you might not or surely don’t want. With a paid subscription, you can also show enhanced Caller ID information.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/screen-unknown-senders-26.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of iPhone Unknown Senders settings\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Filtering unknown senders and spam can prevent most unwanted messages.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While Phone has received the biggest boost at fighting crud, and Messages is not where most of the Medicare and other kinds of relentless fraud come from, it’s still worth enabling in Settings in Apps: Messages: Screen Unknown Senders and Apps: Messages: Filter Spam. This lets you tap Filter: Unknown Senders or Filter Spam to review messages dropped into those buckets.</p>\n<p>This takes more training. I find I have to tap Mark as Known or Not Spam on more messages than phone calls—most phone calls are correctly identified.</p>\n<p>While I’m focused on iPhone here, call screening can be used in Phone for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS; some of the other screening options are slightly different or missing on macOS, but if you have them enabled on your iPhone, the effect is the same. It’s only if your iPhone were turned off that you would see a difference.</p>\n<h2>Liquid strength</h2>\n<p>Look, I know you have feelings about Liquid Glass—speaking to both upgraded people and non-upgraders—but I think there’s a value to overcoming that distaste and taking advantage of the good. Reducing the attention stolen away from you can be worth the cognitive load of adapting to a new interface.</p>\n<p>For those who want extra help in sorting out iOS 26 and spam, you can check out three of my books:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/facetime-messages/?pt=6COLORS\">Take Control of FaceTime and Messages</a>:</strong> This book, which includes full cover of the Phone app across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS, will help you understand everything you can do to fight spam, scams, and many forms of harassment.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/ios-26-ipados-26/?pt=6COLORS\">Take Control of iOS 26 and iPadOS 26</a>:</strong> This title will help any iOS 18 or iPadOS 18 user understand <em>exactly</em> what changed, instead of digging through settings and features in apps.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/iphone-ipad-basics/?pt=6COLORS\">Take Control of iPhone and iPad Basics</a>:</strong> This edition, completely revised for iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, takes you through all the stuff that nobody ever tells you about an operating system, and that it’s just assumed you know.

      "content": "<p><em>Updated with the full text of Apple’s statement below.</em></p>\n<p>According to a statement <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/12/apple-google-ai-siri-gemini.html\">from Apple to CNBC</a>, the company has officially selected Google as the technology partner for its foundation models. News that this deal was in the works had previously been <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2024/03/apple-may-work-with-google-on-a-i-features/\">reported by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman as far back as March of 2024</a>.</p>\n<p>The full implications of this deal aren’t yet known, but it’s likely to affect both Siri as well as other Apple Intelligence features, several of which were first announced in 2024 but have yet to actually ship. Gurman has also previously reported that those delayed Apple Intelligence features are likely to make their debut in iOS 26.4 this spring.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear exactly where in the timeframe we are. Given that 26.3 is already in beta, and 26.4 is expected in a few months, it’s possible that work has long since started on this, even if it’s only being officially announced now.<sup id=\"fnref-38045-cnbc\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38045-cnbc\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup> Even with the leg-up provided by Google’s models, it seems unlikely the company could simply roll in that tech for a feature due out in short order.</p>\n<p>It had previously been thought that Google’s Gemini would be offered as an option via Siri, in the same way that ChatGPT has been available for some time. That was tacitly confirmed by Apple software chief Craig Federighi who said at the company’s 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference, “we may look forward to doing integrations with different models like Google Gemini in the future.” But that deal never materialized—perhaps in part because the two companies were discussing this more substantive deal?</p>\n<p>Either way, Google’s models are clearly a step up from Apple’s own endeavors thus far. The two companies also have a longstanding relationship over search in Safari, which makes this perhaps an unsurprising continuation of that. But as to whether it can help Apple dig itself out of the AI hole in which it’s found itself, well, we’ll find out soon enough.</p>\n<p>Apple provided Six Colors with the full statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p> Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.</p>\n<p>After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google’s Al technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users. Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple’s industry-leading privacy standards.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-38045-cnbc\">\nThe fact that this was announced via a statement to CNBC certainly indicates that the audience of this news is not the tech industry but the financial markets. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-38045-cnbc\" title=\"Return to main content.\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

      "content": "<p>The Verge’s Elizabeth Lopatto in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/policy/859902/apple-google-run-by-cowards\">an absolute scorcher in which she minces no words</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Since X’s users started using Grok to undress women and children using deepfake images, I have been waiting for what I assumed would be inevitable: X getting booted from Apple’s and Google’s app stores. The fact that it hasn’t happened yet tells me something serious about Silicon Valley’s leadership: Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of Elon Musk.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is absolutely unconscionable that, as of this writing, X is not only still on the App Store but is ranked #1 in “News”<sup id=\"fnref-38023-eyes\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38023-eyes\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup> and that Grok is the #3 free app. Moreover, there has been—as far as I have seen—no public statement from Apple or Cook about this situation in the days, at least, over which it has unfolded. Probably because it is indefensible. Even, if at this point, they removed X/Grok from the store—which, don’t get me wrong, <em>they absolutely should</em>—the question would be “what took so long”? Was there something you had to think over? It suggests the company is hoping that all of this will simply blow over. Which is certainly…a <em>choice</em>.</p>\n<p>As Lopatto rightly points out, this exposes Apple’s entire argument that the App Store is there to protect its users for the sham that it has always been.</p>\n<p>Nick Heer, <a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/cook-pichai-cowards/\">writing in his own link to Lopatto’s story</a>, points out “This is why it is a bad idea to rely on private corporations to do the job of regulators and law enforcement.” Yeah. It also points out one of the failures of capitalism at the scale at which these companies operate: there are no market forces that can make an impact here. No number of customers will desert Apple over this that will make so much as a ding on the company’s bottom line. And even if they did, there is only one real alternative, Google, which is <em>doing the exact same thing.</em> The <em>only</em> thing that can force these corporations to act is government regulation—and whoops, this administration has not only pulled the rug out from under its regulatory agencies, it also literally employed the chief perpetrator.</p>\n<p>It’s one thing not to expect <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/10/apples-iceblock-capitulation-is-business-as-usual/\">political activism from large corporations</a>, but to compromise your stated values all in the name of business as usual simply exposes that your values never meant anything in the first place. Lopatto called it right: cowards.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-38023-eyes\">\n🙄 <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-38023-eyes\" title=\"Return to main content.\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/policy/859902/apple-google-run-by-cowards\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2026/01/apple-cowardly-still-has-not-pulled-x-and-grok-from-the-app-store/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>",

Players in purple and white uniforms compete near the basket.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>One of the immersive views is behind and underneath the basket.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I got to watch the first quarter of tonight’s Lakers-Bucks game from the front row by the scorer’s table. Except when I was suspended in the air behind both baskets. Or maybe in a concourse watching people walk to their seats, or occasionally right out on the court for the national anthem or a Laker Girls performance.</p>\n<p>In other words, I was watching it in my Vision Pro during the first live Apple Immersive sports broadcast.</p>\n<p>The experience overall was surprisingly… normal? The video just played, and it felt like watching any other Apple immersive video on the Vision Pro, other than the fact that it was happening live.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Apple and its partners (including Spectrum SportsNet, the Lakers’ TV partner) have learned a lot from their first couple of years experimenting with immersive video. Unlike <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/03/apples-immersive-video-problem/\">previous sports highlight packages</a>, the live broadcast kept switching camera angles to a minimum. For most of the quarter, I watched either from courtside or from behind each basket. I found that I got the hang of switching perspectives when flipping from one basket to the other pretty quickly, and the view of the action was definitely better behind the basket. But seeing action from center court, courtside, also felt like a rare treat.</p>\n<p>Again, my real surprise was that it held up so well: The video was smooth, though when LeBron James zipped right past me, he did get a bit blurry. I’m sure the video quality wouldn’t hold up to close inspection if it were compared with a highly produced and massaged immersive documentary, but it didn’t feel any lower quality than Apple’s previous pro sports efforts, like its MLS, NBA, and Super Bowl highlight packages.</p>\n<p>While I was able to tell the score by looking up at the scoreboard, Apple and Spectrum helpfully added a score graphic located… down on the floor, basically. It never got in the way of the action, but I could look down and quickly pick up the score and the time if I needed to.</p>\n<p>It was novel to hear the play-by-play announcers, who were calling the game specifically for the immersive broadcast, tell me that Bucks coach Doc Rivers was “off to your left on your Vision Pro.” The announcers did a fine job, though I do wonder if it might be wise to have an option that turns off the announcers and lets you just experience the entire thing as a spectator.</p>\n<p>If I have one real criticism of the broadcast, it’s that I’m not sure the sound was entirely right. It sounded good, don’t get me wrong, but it didn’t exactly sound spatial. Sound is one of the ways your brain places you into a scene, and it felt like the sound I was hearing was not really attached to a spatial environment that matched what I was watching. There’s probably some more work to be done on that front.</p>\n<p>Still, this was pretty awesome. Having been to a few women’s college basketball games this past year and sat in the front row, I’ve come to appreciate that when you can see the size of the players, hear them talking, and really get a sense of depth as the ball moves around the court, it’s a very different game than you get in a flat television image. Apple and Spectrum’s immersive NBA game had a similar effect. I’m ready to see more.</p>\n<p>(Anyone with a Vision Pro should be able to watch the replay of the Lakers-Bucks game starting Sunday at 9 am Pacific via the NBA app.)</p>\n",

      "link": "https://sixcolors.com/link/2026/01/more-reports-about-apple-succession-planning/",
      "content": "<p>The Apple executive transition speculation keeps heating up. On Thursday, The New York Times’s Kalley Huang and Tripp Mickle weighed in with a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/technology/apple-ceo-tim-cook-john-ternus.html?unlocked_article_code=1.DFA.Jxal.rai9L1bpJ7xU&amp;smid=url-share\">profile of John Ternus</a>, reportedly a candidate to replace Tim Cook as CEO:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Apple last year began accelerating its planning for Mr. Cook’s succession, according to three people close to the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity about Apple’s confidential deliberations. Mr. Cook, 65, has told senior leaders that he is tired and would like to reduce his workload, the people said. Should he step down, Mr. Cook is likely to become the chairman of Apple’s board, according to three people close to the company.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve expected the transition for Cook to board chair for a while. It makes too much sense, because it allows him to keep doing some work—including, probably, the more high-level political stuff that has become part of Apple’s world—while a new CEO can get their sea legs and focus on other parts of the business. And Cook may not love that political stuff, but I get the strong sense that he’s good at it.</p>\n<p>I don’t know if Tim Cook is really “tired” (maybe it’s from all those early mornings and high-intensity workouts?), but it seems entirely reasonable to me for a 65-year-old man to consider cutting back on his workload and provide support for a CEO transition that he (sadly) couldn’t get from Steve Jobs<sup id=\"fnref-38016-iger\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-38016-iger\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>This part of the article struck me from a pure journalism standpoint:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Despite his low profile, Mr. Ternus appears to have shot to the front of the pack to be Apple’s next C.E.O., according to four people close to the company. But Mr. Cook is also preparing several other internal candidates to be his potential successor, two of the people said. They could include Craig Federighi, Apple’s head of software; Eddy Cue, its head of services; Greg Joswiak, its head of worldwide marketing; and Deirdre O’Brien, its head of retail and human resources.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Note how the attribution changes across those three sentences.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Four people “close to the company” say that Ternus is the frontrunner to be CEO.</li>\n<li>Two of those people say Cook is preparing other candidates as well.</li>\n<li>And then… uh, here are some names.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The placement of those sentences would imply that they’re all of a kind, but they actually seem to be in decreasing order of accuracy. Four people say Ternus is the frontrunner. Two say he’s not the only person being prepared. And then… there’s a list of names, which you might assume were floated by the previous sources, but the article doesn’t actually say that.</p>\n<p>My guess: An editor at the <em>Times</em> got out their red pen (or modern equivalent) and wrote “Who?” next to “several other internal candidates.” So Huang and Mickle supplied some names. But did they get those names from sources? It doesn’t say so. It reads more like they got those names from Apple’s executive page and their own musings. Let’s make no assumptions about the fact that Federighi, Cue, Joswiak, and O’Brien are listed.</p>\n<p>Also, it would be completely irresponsible for Tim Cook not to prepare several other candidates to be his potential successor. What if something happens to John Ternus? What if the board decides, for whatever reason, they just can’t hire him? What if the board has asked Cook to prepare several candidates for the job, in case they aren’t satisfied with his preferred choice? This seems like basic good governance to me. It doesn’t mean that the fix is in, nor does it mean that there’s a legitimate competition going on.</p>\n<p>The more I think about this entire process, the more I reflect on the fact that Cook himself had to step in for Jobs multiple times due to his predecessor’s failing health. And when Jobs finally made the decision to move up to the job of Chairman and <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2025/08/the-tim-cook-era-14-years-of-products-profits-and-politics/\">Cook was named CEO</a>, he was too ill to really act as that form of mentor before he died a couple of months later.</p>\n<p>I have to think that, above all else, Tim Cook wants to provide his successor a better transition. And it’s impossible not to look at the ongoing reports from Bloomberg, the Financial Times, and now the New York Times and not get the sense that Cook’s succession planning is kicking into gear.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-38016-iger\">\nNot to mention the disastrous transitions at other companies, like Bob Iger’s long goodbye-or-not at Disney that’s still ongoing. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-38016-iger\" title=\"Return to main content.\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/technology/apple-ceo-tim-cook-john-ternus.html?unlocked_article_code=1.DFA.Jxal.rai9L1bpJ7xU&#038;smid=url-share\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2026/01/more-reports-about-apple-succession-planning/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>As <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/08/apple-shareholders-meeting-2026/\">reported by Eric Slivka at MacRumors</a>, both Apple’s Chairman of the Board Arthur Levinson and board member Ronald Sugar are standing for re-election at this year’s shareholder meeting, despite exceeding the company’s stated age limits.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000320193/3da83426-e573-457b-ba2e-c73afb4888be.html#AAPL014016-DEF14A_HTM_aapl014016-def14aa012\">the company’s proxy statement</a>, it presented the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Over the past four years, the Board has added three new members, representing over one-third of its membership, and two other, long-serving members retired. In the context of this year’s Annual Meeting nominations, the Board determined that it would be in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders to ask Art Levinson, the Chair of the Board, and Ron Sugar, the Chair of the Audit Committee, to stand for re-election, and to waive for each of them its guideline under which directors generally may not stand for re-election after attaining age 75. In making this determination, the Board considered several factors, including the significant experience and expertise that each of Dr. Levinson and Dr. Sugar brings to the Board, their deep insight into the Company’s business and operations, and their individual contributions as highly engaged members of the Board. The Board also considered the benefits of continuity among the Board’s leadership positions.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I admit, I found this decision surprising, if not shocking. It would seem to put paid to the idea of Tim Cook <em>imminently</em> taking over the role of chairman, though it does support the idea that will happen sooner rather than later—otherwise it seems as though the company would have considered nominating an entirely new chairperson. As it is, the composition of the board remains exactly the same.</p>\n<p>However, it doesn’t mean that the company won’t announce transition plans in the near future, as rumors have suggested. It’s most likely it simply wasn’t ready to do so at the point at which it needed to submit this document to the SEC. The <em>New York Times</em> just <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/technology/apple-ceo-tim-cook-john-ternus.html\">ran a profile of John Ternus</a>, which further elevates his profile as Cook’s successor, especially in the nearer term.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the move to stay the course is a conservative one from a company that these days has become more conservative when it comes to matters of corporate governance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/08/apple-shareholders-meeting-2026/\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2026/01/apple-board-members-will-stand-for-re-election-despite-age-limits/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>",

Next to them is a book titled 'Field Notes' with a rocket launch image and a black pen.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Left to right: iPhone Air, Field Notes and pen, iPhone Fold mock-up, iPhone 17 Pro.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If many years-long rumors are true, 2026 will be the year when Apple’s long-gestating folding iPhone becomes a reality. But there are a lot of different approaches to folding phones out there, and there’s no guarantee that the folding iPhone <em>you</em> imagine is the one that Apple is imagining.</p>\n<p>Leaks from Apple’s supply chain have begun to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/29/foldable-iphone-mockup-hands-on/\">strongly suggest the shape and size</a> of the product we’ll call, for lack of a better name, the iPhone Fold. And since it’s likely going to be nine months before anyone holds one of these things in their hands, this seems like as good a time as any to consider the story Apple is likely to tell when it’s selling this device.</p>\n<h2>Not your usual iPhone</h2>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/foldy-on-back-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Two phone cases on a wooden surface: a blue one with circular cutouts and a red one with square cutouts for camera lenses.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><br>\n</figure>\n<p>First, a disclaimer: Nobody knows anything, except the people who do. We’re left to go on rumors and extrapolation. That said, many people have spent time doing the math required to <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumoured-iphone-fold-size-concept-drawing-and-renders.2456447/\">extrapolate the shape of the new iPhone</a> based on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/iphone-fold-display-resolutions-cameras/\">rumored specs</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/have-a-3d-printer-you-can-make-your-own-iphone-fold-dummy/\">building a 3D printing template</a> so you can build one and hold it in the real world.</p>\n<p>If these mock-ups are real, this folding iPhone is not going to be what you may have pictured in your head: a modern iPhone, roughly the shape of an iPhone Pro, that folds open to reveal a larger screen inside.</p>\n<p>Instead, Apple may be making a device that’s much wider and squatter than existing iPhones when it’s folded up. The mock-ups people are printing show a phone that’s squatter than an iPhone mini and wider than an iPhone Pro Max! If that shape is right, the iPhone Fold will look a bit more like a mini notebook when it’s folded, unlike any iPhone that has ever existed.</p>\n<p>The shape makes sense, however, when you imagine what that phone looks like when it’s unfolded: a screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio, the shape of an old-school television and—more importantly—an old-school iPad. In fact, this rumored design would make the unfolded iPhone the shape of an iPad, just slightly smaller than the iPad mini. (The iPad mini’s screen is 8.3 inches when measured diagonally, while this screen is rumored to be 7.76 inches.)</p>\n<h2>Apple’s sales pitch?</h2>\n<figure><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/foldy-open-wide-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"A Field Notes notebook with a pink cover and blue edges lies open on a wooden surface next to a black pen with a blue tip and a magazine featuring a rocket launch.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Apple’s taking a real risk if the new folding iPhone doesn’t look like an iPhone. If people read it as looking weird or lesser in some way, that may turn them off—even if they were otherwise willing to buy a $2000+ phone. So why would they do it?</p>\n<p>Here’s my guess at Apple’s thought process: If what you really want is an iPhone that looks like an iPhone, literally all the other iPhone models will deliver on that. The iPhone Fold is designed around what it provides when it’s unfolded. Yes, when it’s folded, it will work like a normal, albeit squat, iPhone. But it comes alive and is unique when it’s open.</p>\n<p>When it’s open, it’s an iPad.</p>\n<p>The battle between iOS and Android rages on in the smartphone world. Apple leads in some markets, Android in others. It’s a duopoly, and both companies are making a lot of money and wielding a lot of power based on their successes in that market. But in the tablet market, the truth is that the iPad is successful, and every other tablet out there is not. Not only in terms of sales and profits, but in terms of functionality.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Google has rededicated itself multiple times to the idea that Android is going to be a better operating system for tablets, and that Android tablet apps are going to get better. And yet every time I use an Android tablet, I’m struck by just how awful the experience is compared to an iPad. Even now, most apps just feel like phone apps wearing clothes several sizes too large.</p>\n<p>This is Apple’s big advantage when it comes to a phone that can open up to become something much larger: That larger thing can be an iPad, with apps that make sense in that size and shape. Apple has separated iOS and iPadOS, but they are essentially the same operating system, with some differentiated features based on what hardware is involved. Apple can bring as much or as little of iPadOS to the iPhone Fold experience as it wants to.</p>\n<p>I’m not sure what will make the move across. Will full-on windowed multitasking be offered, or will Apple limit it to some basic tiling? Will the iPhone Fold be the first iPhone to support the Apple Pencil? Will the iPhone Fold drive an external display? It’s all for Apple to decide.</p>\n<p>But after looking at these 3D-printed mock-ups and seeing a squat, paper-notepad-shaped iPhone that unfolds into a small iPad, it seems pretty clear to me: If this is the shape of the iPhone Fold to come, Apple is focusing on it being an iPad you can fold up and stick in your pocket, not as an iPhone that unfolds into two iPhones placed side by side.</p>\n<p>[<em>Thanks to Stephen Hackett for the photos.</em>]</p>\n",

You could read your messages on potentially several devices: your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, home Mac, and laptop or work Mac. Most of us have at least two of those. When you read a message, reply to a conversation, or start a new one, where should the messages that comprise the conversation live?</p>\n<p>Before iCloud for Messages, Apple generally synced messages among devices that were logged into the same iCloud account <em>and</em> were awake, among other parameters. If one was turned off or lacked an Internet connection, the sync might never happen, leaving an incomplete record across your communications.</p>\n<p>When you enable Messages in iCloud on all of your devices, all incoming SMS, MMS, iMessage, and RCS messages are ostensibly received by at least one device, uniquely labeled, and encrypted for upload to your iCloud account, where other devices retrieve the updates.<sup id=\"fnref-37924-security\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-37924-security\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\" title=\"Read footnote.\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>This leads to reader Phil’s peculiar situation.

I quickly turned off the Messages app on my Mac Mini (thinking I could avoid switching the storage of my Messages to iCloud).</p>\n<p>  Subsequently, I checked my iCloud storage, and I had Messages turned OFF for the cloud. What is going on here? If my messages were not residing in the cloud, how could the Mac Mini Messages app pick up some stuff from one of my Messages threads?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Where I think Phil is being bitten is the default synchronization that occurs among any devices logged into the same iCloud account, whether or not Messages in iCloud is enabled. Some aspects of this can be disabled; other parts of the process require logging out of Messages entirely.</p>\n<p>Here’s what you can check using iOS 26/iPadOS 26 and macOS 26 locations and labels:</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/messages-forwarding-ios26-bordered.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of iPhone settings for Text Message Forwarding for Messages showing devices that receive incoming SMS and MMS.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"><figcaption>Prevent text messages from passing beyond your iPhone by disabling forwarding devices.</figcaption></figure>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Disable Messages in iCloud:</strong> Ensure you aren’t syncing via iCloud.

I’m not sure why this was never a feature before, but I absolutely love it.</p>\n<p><strong>Preview app on iOS/iPadOS</strong> – The Quick Look option previously offered by Files was fine for doing exactly what it said on the tin, but for anything more in-depth, the shortcomings of smushing PDFs into the Files app became quickly apparent. Fortunately, after only eighteen years, Apple finally shipped its own PDF viewer on both the iPhone and iPad, and it’s really improved the experience of dealing with PDFs on those devices.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SleepScore87-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of a sleep tracking app showing a high sleep score of 87. It includes duration (46/50), bedtime (29/30), and interruptions (12/20). A circular progress bar visualizes the score, with a motivational message below.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Sleep Score</strong> – Continuing this year’s theme, which is apparently “arbitrariness”, yes, the idea of scoring one’s sleep on a 100 point scale seems ridiculous, but I’ve found that since starting to track my sleep with Apple’s Sleep Score feature, I get antsy when I don’t do it. Yes, there are other apps that take more direct health metrics into account, but Apple’s scores being potentially more inflated do weirdly make me feel better about my sleep? So I guess that’s something.</p>\n<h2>Apps</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nike-run-club-running-coach/id387771637\"><strong>Nike Run Club</strong></a> – I got back into running for several months this year, though the cold weather has recently put paid to that. However, I still really appreciate the Nike Run Club app for its Guided Run feature, which provides an audio accompaniment to your workouts, often in the form of the very cheerful “real life Ted Lasso” Coach Bennett; it puts Apple’s soulless Workout Buddy feature to shame. Having a Watch app that lets me download the audio guides to listen to locally, and therefore not require me to bring my phone along, is an added bonus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise-ambient-sounds/id1465439395\"><strong>Dark Noise</strong></a>  – Speaking of sleep, I’ve gotten more into using white noise this year when I wake up in the middle of the night, and Charlie Chapman’s Dark Noise app has become my weapon of choice. Great assortment of sounds, easy to use, and it lets you make custom mixes of your sounds. (My personal favorite is a mix of Airplane Interior with Green Noise. Puts me right out.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wipr-2/id1662217862\"><strong>Wipr 2</strong></a> – I retired 1Blocker this year in favor of this little indie app by Kaylee Calderolla. It’s a universal app across all of Apple’s platforms, easy to set up, and does its job without ever getting in your way. Best of all it’s a paid app that doesn’t require a subscription! Buy once and you’re done.</p>\n\n<h2>Film</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Wake Up Dead Man</strong></em> (Netflix) – The third Benoit Blanc movie is fantastic. I was lucky enough to catch it in a cinema and it was my favorite moviegoing experience of the year. Good mystery, great performances, and Johnson (who I’ve been a fan of since his debut, <em>Brick</em>) always has a great eye for filmmaking. I hope they keep making these as long as he and Daniel Craig are up for it; they’re endlessly entertaining.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Thunderbolts*</strong></em> (Disney+, or rent/buy) – Of all the superhero movies this year, this was my favorite. I’m a longtime MCU fan, but even I’ve been left cold by some of the most recent entries (sorry, <em>Fantastic Four</em>). <em>Thunderbolts*</em> proved to me that there’s still life in the franchise, and a lot of that is down to great work by Florence Pugh, who continues to steal pretty much every scene she’s in. Most of all, though, this is a movie that has <em>heart</em> and is about something, and that’s what too many genre films often forget: the genre conventions are there to enhance your storytelling, like a great sauce, not to necessarily be the main course itself.</p>\n<p><em><strong>F1: The Movie</strong></em> (Apple TV) – Throwing this in here just because I watched it very recently and Joseph Kosinski shows that he continues to thrive in his role as spiritual successor to the late Tony Scott in delivering high-stakes blockbusters that look great, sound great, and hit all the right levers for building tension. Plus the car footage is really, really good if you’re into that sort of thing.</p>\n<h2>Books</h2>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316361488/?tag=dashfi-20\"><strong>Empire of the Wolf</strong></a> by Richard Swan</em> – A dark fantasy trilogy set in a world where the laws are enforced by roving justices who serve as judge, jury, and executor. But the empire is beginning to crumble, as empires do, and this chronicles its fall through the eyes of Helena, an assistant to one such justice, Konrad Vonvalt. Swan, himself a former lawyer, is not only great at building out this world in exacting detail, but peopling it with interesting and compelling characters.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1982141174/?tag=dashfi-20\"><strong>The Will of the Many</strong>/<strong>The Strength of the Few</strong></a> by James Islington</em> – The first two volumes of a truly sprawling fantasy epic, this is the story of Vis, a young man who has vowed revenge on those who destroyed his life, the Catenan Republic. The Republic a powerful nation that has mastered the power of Will, which is ceded by citizens in a pyramid structure that gives the people higher up mathematically increasing power based on how many people are ceding to them. But there are levels within levels of intrigue here as Vis is recruited to unwind another mystery, the death of a young man at the Republic’s prestigious Academy. The second book takes matters in a truly wild direction that I can’t divulge without spoiling too much, but I’m eagerly anticipating the third.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1616964340/?tag=dashfi-20\"><strong>If Wishes Were Retail</strong></a>  by Auston Habershaw</em> – Disclaimer upfront: this book is a by a friend who’s also represented by my agent. That aside, this is an extremely fun and funny fantastic story about a genie who sets up a kiosk in the local mall and starts selling wishes. He recruits help in the form of the novel’s protagonist, a teenage girl named Alex, and hijinks ensue. Despite its comedic bent, it’s also a book about the family we can’t live with or without and has a lot of heart.</p>\n<p>Honorable mentions: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/059365322X/?tag=dashfi-20\"><em>We Solve Murders</em></a> by Richard Osman, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1PMMX8N/?tag=dashfi-20\"><em>The Tomb of Dragons</em></a> by Katherine Addison, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316568104/?tag=dashfi-20\"><em>Royal Gambit</em></a> by Daniel O’Malley.</p>\n<h2>Television</h2>\n<p><em><strong>The Lowdown</strong></em> (Hulu) – I’d be hard-pressed to find a show that is more up my alley. In this Tulsa-set crime story from <em>Reservation Dogs</em> creator Sterlin Harjo, low-rent truthstorian/journalist/private investigator Lee Raybon (Ethan Hawke) is looking into the death of the wealthy and eccentric Dale Washberg (Tim Blake Nelson), whose brother, Donald (Kyle MacLachlan), is running for governor. In the best noir fashion, this plot unfolds into much, much more, set against the backdrop of the state’s complicated relationship with its Native American population. Hawke is at his best here, whether it’s getting beat up for poking his nose into matters or trying desperately to stay connected to his teenage daughter (<em>Skeleton Crew</em>‘s Ryan Kiera Armstrong). Funny, twisty, and incisive.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Andor</strong></em> (Disney+) – If I have to explain what this show is to you, I honestly do not know what space rock you have been under. But the second season of this Star Wars series delivers in spades, as Cassian Andor comes into his own amidst the burgeoning rebellion. Standout performances not only from lead Diego Luna but Mon Mothma portrayer Genevieve O’Reilly, Stellan Skarsgard as the devious Luthen, and relative newcomer Elizabeth Dulau as Luthen’s partner in crime Kleya. If this doesn’t take your breath away at least a couple times this season, you should check your Apple Watch and make sure you have a pulse.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Peacemaker</strong></em> (HBO Max) – Nobody is perhaps more surprised than I am to find this show on my best of the year list, but I’m still thinking about it months later. On its tin, I could swear that this show—about a somewhat meat-headed and violent “hero”—isn’t the kind of show I’m into and while it does occasionally veer into sophomoric humor that isn’t quite my bag, it’s still very funny and, as I mentioned above, is actually <em>about</em> something: in this case, coming to terms with your past and your regrets. John Cena has ably made the jump from wrestling to acting, and there’s a great supporting cast of wacky characters, from which my MVP is the dweeby, sociopathic Adrian Chase (Freddie Stroma). It does, alas, end on a bit of a cliffhanger as part of the revamped DC Universe, but assuming James Gunn remains in creative control over there, I’m sure we haven’t seen the last of these characters. Plus, have I mentioned they actually topped season one’s theme song?</p>\n<p>Honorable mentions: <em>Severance</em> season 2 (Apple TV), <em>Foundation</em> season 3 (Apple TV), <em>Ludwig</em> (BritBox).</p>\n<h2>Music</h2>\n<p>I’m not usually a huge music person, as I tend mostly to listen to movie and video game scores (for which this year I’d recommend Brandon Roberts’s season two <em>Andor</em> accompaniment and Wilbert Roget, II’s <em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> soundtrack—what can I say, I’m consistent?), but I figured I’d call out three songs that were on heavy repeat in my year-end recaps.</p>\n<p><strong>“Don’t Let Me Down” by ELO</strong> – An oldie but a goodie. I’m not sure how I missed this for, oh, all of my life, but it came up on my Apple Music station at the beginning of this year and it’s still a “never skip” when it comes up.</p>\n<p><strong>“Oh Lord” by Foxy Shazam</strong> – The aforementioned theme song to <em>Peacemaker</em> season two. An absolute banger.</p>\n<p><strong>“Save it For Later” by Eddie Vedder</strong> – Yeah, it was in <em>The Bear</em> this year (as have been several versions of the song over the seasons, apparently). Just a really great song.</p>\n<h2>Games</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></strong> (PS5, Xbox) – A triple A Indiana Jones adventure? Sign me up. It’s simply great, nailing the feeling of being Indy, from whip tricks to puzzles to punching Nazis. Troy Baker taking over for Harrison Ford is simply astonishing: not good enough perhaps to convince you he is Ford, but good enough to pass for Indy. I appreciate that it’s not too laden down with mechanics—in that sense it’s more <em>Uncharted</em> than <em>Tomb Raider</em>. Probably better than a few of the movies. I’d certainly play more!</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></strong> (Most platforms) – I love a good puzzle game and this fit the bill. You have to reconstruct several tableaus from over the course of a couple centuries, all revolving around a mysterious idol. The game requires you deduce what happened, not dissimilar from one of my past favorites, <em>Return of the Obra-Dinn</em>, while a storyline arcs from the past onward. I played it obsessively during a trip earlier this year, though I haven’t quite managed to get through the sequel (<em>The Curse of the Golden Idol</em>) yet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Pips</em></strong> (iOS, web) – The New York Times Games department has built an extensive game repertoire now, with some better than others. While I still religiously do the crossword, Wordle, and Connections, I was surprised to find myself so compelled by the latest addition, Pips. It’s a logic game where you have to place dominos on a board to meet certain conditions (such as all values within a certain region being equal, or summing to a certain number). This isn’t usually my style, but there is something so well-done about Pips that I often find it the game I’m most excited to play on any given day. I also appreciate that the times offers three difficulty levels everyday: while I can usually solve the easy puzzle in a matter of seconds, I have found hard puzzles occasionally vexing me for 15 minutes or more.</p>\n<h2>Miscellaneous things</h2>\n<p>This is the year I put <strong>solar panels</strong> on my house, and though I no longer check my app quite as feverishly as I did in early months (chalk some of that up to the lower production rates of the winter), I’m extremely glad that we had them installed. Just seeing my electric bills zero out through the hot summer months was delightful in itself.</p>\n<p>I really loved Whole Foods’s new Limited Edition <strong>Blood Orange seltzer</strong>. Make it year-round, you cowards!</p>\n<p>This year I got more into <strong>fixing stuff</strong>. I put a new battery in our baby monitor, repaired the light table from my kid’s daycare classroom, and replaced some light switches and outlets in a room we were redoing. Nothing quite as satisfying as getting something working right. I’m not sure whether that will continue in 2026, but I definitely found it rewarding.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-37893-affiliate\">\nAs a note, some of these categories may feature affiliate links to these things for which I get a small amount of recompense. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-37893-affiliate\" title=\"Return to main content.\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

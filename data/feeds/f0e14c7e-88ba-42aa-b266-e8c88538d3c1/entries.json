      "content": "<p>A new Internet-of-Things (IoT) botnet called <strong>Kimwolf</strong> has spread to more than 2 million devices, forcing infected systems to participate in massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay other malicious and abusive Internet traffic. Kimwolf&#8217;s ability to scan the local networks of compromised systems for other IoT devices to infect makes it a sobering threat to organizations, and new research reveals Kimwolf is surprisingly prevalent in government and corporate networks.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73083\" style=\"width: 625px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73083\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73083\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ss-botnet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"615\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-73083\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image: Shutterstock, @Elzicon.</p></div>\n<p>Kimwolf grew rapidly in the waning months of 2025 by tricking various &#8220;residential proxy&#8221; services into relaying malicious commands to devices on the local networks of those proxy endpoints. Residential proxies are sold as a way to anonymize and localize one&#8217;s Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their Internet activity through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.</p>\n<p>The malware that turns one&#8217;s Internet connection into a proxy node is often quietly bundled with various mobile apps and games, and it typically forces the infected device to relay malicious and abusive traffic &#8212; including ad fraud, account takeover attempts, and mass content-scraping.</p>\n<p>Kimwolf mainly targeted proxies from <strong>IPIDEA</strong>, a Chinese service that has millions of proxy endpoints for rent on any given week. The Kimwolf operators discovered they could <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forward malicious commands</a> to the internal networks of IPIDEA proxy endpoints, and then programmatically scan for and infect other vulnerable devices on each endpoint&#8217;s local network.</p>\n<p>Most of the systems compromised through Kimwolf&#8217;s local network scanning have been unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. These are typically Android Open Source Project devices &#8212; not Android TV OS devices or Play Protect certified Android devices &#8212; and they are generally marketed as a way to watch unlimited (read:pirated) video content from popular subscription streaming services for a one-time fee.</p>\n<p>However, a great many of these TV boxes ship to consumers with residential proxy software pre-installed. What&#8217;s more, they have no real security or authentication built-in: If you can communicate directly with the TV box, you can also easily compromise it with malware.</p>\n<p>While IPIDEA and other affected proxy providers recently have taken steps to block threats like Kimwolf from going upstream into their endpoints (reportedly with varying degrees of success), the Kimwolf malware remains on millions of infected devices.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73086\" style=\"width: 757px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73086\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-73086\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ipidea2023.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"747\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ipidea2023.png 1219w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ipidea2023-768x387.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ipidea2023-782x395.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-73086\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A screenshot of IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy service.</p></div>\n<p>Kimwolf&#8217;s close association with residential proxy networks and compromised Android TV boxes might suggest we&#8217;d find relatively few infections on corporate networks. However, the security firm <strong>Infoblox</strong> said a recent review of its customer traffic found <em>nearly 25 percent of them made a query to a Kimwolf-related domain name since October 1, 2025</em>, when the botnet first showed signs of life.</p>\n<p>Infoblox found the affected customers are based all over the world and in a wide range of industry verticals, from education and healthcare to government and finance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be clear, this suggests that nearly 25% of customers had at least one device that was an endpoint in a residential proxy service targeted by Kimwolf operators,&#8221; Infoblox <a href=\"https://www.infoblox.com/blog/threat-intelligence/kimwolf-howls-from-inside-the-enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explained</a>. &#8220;Such a device, maybe a phone or a laptop, was essentially co-opted by the threat actor to probe the local network for vulnerable devices. A query means a scan was made, not that new devices were compromised.

Spur found residential proxies in nearly 300 government owned and operated networks, 318 utility companies, 166 healthcare companies or hospitals, and 141 companies in banking and finance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I looked at the 298 [government] owned and operated [networks], and so many of them were DoD [U.S. Department of Defense], which is kind of terrifying that DoD has IPIDEA and these other proxy services located inside of it,&#8221; Spur Co-Founder <strong>Riley Kilmer</strong> said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how these enterprises have these networks set up. It could be that [infected devices] are segregated on the network, that even if you had local access it doesn&#8217;t really mean much. However, it&#8217;s something to be aware of. If a device goes in, anything that device has access to the proxy would have access to.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kilmer said Kimwolf demonstrates how a single residential proxy infection can quickly lead to bigger problems for organizations that are harboring unsecured devices behind their firewalls, noting that proxy services present a potentially simple way for attackers to probe other devices on the local network of a targeted organization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you know you have [proxy] infections that are located in a company, you can chose that [network] to come out of and then locally pivot,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;If you have an idea of where to start or look, now you have a foothold in a company or an enterprise based on just that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is the third story in our series on the Kimwolf botnet.

As a result, rapid patching currently remains the only effective mitigation.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Goettl</strong>, vice president of product management at <strong>Ivanti</strong>, observed that CVE-2026-20805 affects all currently supported and extended security update supported versions of the Windows OS. Goettl said it would be a mistake to dismiss the severity of this flaw based on its &#8220;Important&#8221; rating and relatively low CVSS score.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A risk-based prioritization methodology warrants treating this vulnerability as a higher severity than the vendor rating or CVSS score assigned,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Among the critical flaws patched this month are two <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> remote code execution bugs (<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-20952\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2026-20952</a> and <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-20953\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2026-20953</a>) that can be triggered just by viewing a booby-trapped message in the Preview Pane.</p>\n<p>Our October 2025 Patch Tuesday <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/patch-tuesday-october-2025-end-of-10-edition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;End of 10&#8221; roundup</a> noted that Microsoft had removed a modem driver from all versions after it was discovered that hackers were abusing a vulnerability in it to hack into systems. <strong>Adam Barnett</strong> at <strong>Rapid7</strong> said Microsoft today removed another couple of modem drivers from Windows for a broadly similar reason: Microsoft is aware of functional exploit code for an elevation of privilege vulnerability in a very similar modem driver, tracked as <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2023-31096\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2023-31096</a>.<span id=\"more-73059\"></span></p>\n<p>&#8220;That’s not a typo; this vulnerability was originally published via MITRE over two years ago, along with a credible public writeup by the original researcher,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;Today’s Windows patches remove agrsm64.sys and agrsm.sys. All three modem drivers were originally developed by the same now-defunct third party, and have been included in Windows for decades. These driver removals will pass unnoticed for most people, but you might find active modems still in a few contexts, including some industrial control systems.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Barnett, two questions remain: How many more legacy modem drivers are still present on a fully-patched Windows asset; and how many more elevation-to-SYSTEM vulnerabilities will emerge from them before Microsoft cuts off attackers who have been enjoying &#8220;living off the land[line] by exploiting an entire class of dusty old device drivers?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Although Microsoft doesn’t claim evidence of exploitation for CVE-2023-31096, the relevant 2023 write-up and the 2025 removal of the other Agere modem driver have provided two strong signals for anyone looking for Windows exploits in the meantime,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;In case you were wondering, there is no need to have a modem connected; the mere presence of the driver is enough to render an asset vulnerable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Immersive, Ivanti and Rapid7 all called attention to <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21265\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2026-21265</a>, which is a critical Security Feature Bypass vulnerability affecting Windows Secure Boot. This security feature is designed to protect against threats like rootkits and bootkits, and it relies on a set of certificates that are set to expire in June 2026 and October 2026. Once these 2011 certificates expire, Windows devices that do not have the new 2023 certificates can no longer receive Secure Boot security fixes.</p>\n<p>Barnett cautioned that when updating the bootloader and BIOS, it is essential to prepare fully ahead of time for the specific OS and BIOS combination you’re working with, since incorrect remediation steps can lead to an unbootable system.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fifteen years is a very long time indeed in information security, but the clock is running out on the Microsoft root certificates which have been signing essentially everything in the Secure Boot ecosystem since the days of Stuxnet,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;Microsoft issued replacement certificates back in 2023, alongside CVE-2023-24932 which covered relevant Windows patches as well as subsequent steps to remediate the Secure Boot bypass exploited by the BlackLotus bootkit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Goettl noted that <strong>Mozilla</strong> has released updates for <strong>Firefox</strong> and <strong>Firefox ESR</strong> resolving a total of 34 vulnerabilities, two of which are suspected to be exploited (CVE-2026-0891 and CVE-2026-0892). Both are resolved in Firefox 147 (MFSA2026-01) and CVE-2026-0891 is resolved in Firefox ESR 140.7 (MFSA2026-03).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Expect <strong>Google Chrome</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> updates this week in addition to a high severity vulnerability in Chrome WebView that was resolved in the January 6 Chrome update (CVE-2026-0628),&#8221; Goettl said.</p>\n<p>As ever, the <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/January%202026%20Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%20Summary/32624/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SANS Internet Storm Center</a> has a per-patch breakdown by severity and urgency.

Very quickly, the residential proxy&#8217;s Internet address starts funneling traffic that is linked to ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping.</p>\n<p>The XLab report explained its researchers found &#8220;definitive evidence&#8221; that the same cybercriminal actors and infrastructure were used to deploy both Kimwolf and the <strong>Aisuru botnet </strong>&#8212; an earlier version of Kimwolf that also enslaved devices for use in DDoS attacks and proxy services.</p>\n<p>XLab said it suspected since October that Kimwolf and Aisuru had the same author(s) and operators, based in part on shared code changes over time. But it said those suspicions were confirmed on December 8 when it witnessed both botnet strains being distributed by the same Internet address at <strong>93.95.112[.]59</strong>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73024\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73024\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-73024\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/XLab-resito.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"661\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-73024\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image: XLab.</p></div>\n<h2>RESI RACK</h2>\n<p>Public records show the Internet address range flagged by XLab is assigned to Lehi, Utah-based <strong>Resi Rack LLC</strong>.

Less than a month later, Shox and Linus told customers they would soon cease offering static ISP proxies as a result of these policy changes.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73006\" style=\"width: 529px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73006\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73006\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shox-linus-static-att.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"519\" height=\"537\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-73006\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shox and Linux, talking about their decision to stop selling ISP proxies.</p></div>\n<h2>DORT &amp; SNOW</h2>\n<p>The stated owner of the resi[.]to Discord server went by the abbreviated username &#8220;D.&#8221; That initial appears to be short for the hacker handle &#8220;<strong>Dort</strong>,&#8221; a name that was invoked frequently throughout these Discord chats.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73003\" style=\"width: 617px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73003\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73003\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/resito-d-profile.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"607\" height=\"765\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-73003\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dort&#8217;s profile on resi dot to.</p></div>\n<p>This &#8220;Dort&#8221; nickname came up in KrebsOnSecurity&#8217;s recent conversations with &#8220;<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/forky/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Forky</strong></a>,&#8221; a Brazilian man who <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acknowledged</a> being involved in the marketing of the Aisuru botnet at its inception in late 2024.

Synthient found that two-thirds of the Kimwolf infections are Android TV boxes with no security or authentication built in.</p></div>\n<p>The past few months have witnessed the explosive growth of a new botnet dubbed <strong>Kimwolf</strong>, which experts say has infected more than 2 million devices globally. The Kimwolf malware forces compromised systems to relay malicious and abusive Internet traffic &#8212; such as ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping &#8212; and participate in crippling distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks capable of knocking nearly any website offline for days at a time.</p>\n<p>More important than Kimwolf&#8217;s staggering size, however, is the diabolical method it uses to spread so quickly: By effectively tunneling back through various &#8220;<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">residential proxy</a>&#8221; networks and into the local networks of the proxy endpoints, and by further infecting devices that are hidden behind the assumed protection of the user&#8217;s firewall and Internet router.</p>\n<p>Residential proxy networks are sold as a way for customers to anonymize and localize their Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their traffic through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.</p>\n<p>The malware that turns an end-user&#8217;s Internet connection into a proxy node is often bundled with dodgy mobile apps and games. These residential proxy programs also are commonly installed via <strong>unofficial Android TV boxes</strong> sold by third-party merchants on popular e-commerce sites like <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>BestBuy, Newegg</strong>, and <strong>Walmart</strong>.</p>\n<p>These TV boxes range in price from $40 to $400, are marketed under <a href=\"https://github.com/synthient/public-research/blob/main/2026/01/kimwolf/product_devices.csv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a dizzying range of no-name brands and model numbers</a>, and <em>frequently are advertised as a way to stream certain types of subscription video content for free</em>. But there&#8217;s a hidden cost to this transaction: As we&#8217;ll explore in a moment, these TV boxes make up a considerable chunk of the estimated two million systems currently infected with Kimwolf.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72949\" style=\"width: 756px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/u-androidtv-kimwolf.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72949\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-72949\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/u-androidtv-kimwolf.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"746\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/u-androidtv-kimwolf.png 1410w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/u-androidtv-kimwolf-768x440.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/u-androidtv-kimwolf-782x448.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72949\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some of the unsanctioned Android TV boxes that come with residential proxy malware pre-installed. Image: Synthient.</p></div>\n<p>Kimwolf also is quite good at infecting a range of Internet-connected digital photo frames that likewise are abundant at major e-commerce websites. In November 2025, researchers from <strong>Quokka</strong> published <a href=\"https://go.quokka.io/hubfs/App-Intel/Technical_Uhale-Digital-Picture-Frame-Security-Assessment.pdf?is=1ef7934f6635b02395adcab09a0c1b24bf0ea745b648bfe87189de8aadc7300b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a report</a> (PDF) detailing serious security issues in Android-based digital picture frames running the <strong>Uhale app &#8212; </strong>including Amazon&#8217;s bestselling digital frame as of March 2025.</p>\n<p>There are two major security problems with these photo frames and unofficial Android TV boxes. The first is that a considerable percentage of them come with malware pre-installed, or else require the user to download an unofficial Android App Store and malware in order to use the device for its stated purpose (video content piracy). The most typical of these uninvited guests are small programs that turn the device into a residential proxy node that is resold to others.</p>\n<p>The second big security nightmare with these photo frames and unsanctioned Android TV boxes is that they rely on a handful of Internet-connected microcomputer boards that have no discernible security or authentication requirements built-in. In other words, if you are on the same network as one or more of these devices, you can likely compromise them simultaneously by issuing a single command across the network.</p>\n<h2>THERE&#8217;S NO PLACE LIKE 127.0.0.1</h2>\n<p>The combination of these two security realities came to the fore in October 2025, when an undergraduate computer science student at the <strong>Rochester Institute of Technology</strong> began closely tracking Kimwolf&#8217;s growth, and interacting directly with its apparent creators on a daily basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin Brundage </strong>is the 22-year-old founder of the security firm <strong>Synthient</strong>, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks and learn how those networks are being abused. Conducting much of his research into Kimwolf while studying for final exams, Brundage told KrebsOnSecurity in late October 2025 he suspected Kimwolf was a new Android-based variant of <strong>Aisuru</strong>, a botnet that was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">incorrectly blamed</a> for a number of record-smashing DDoS attacks last fall.</p>\n<p>Brundage says Kimwolf grew rapidly by abusing a glaring vulnerability in many of the world&#8217;s largest residential proxy services. The crux of the weakness, he explained, was that these proxy services weren&#8217;t doing enough to prevent their customers from forwarding requests to internal servers of the individual proxy endpoints.</p>\n<p>Most proxy services take basic steps to prevent their paying customers from &#8220;going upstream&#8221; into the local network of proxy endpoints, by explicitly denying requests for local addresses specified in <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RFC-1918</a>, including the well-known <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/network-address-translation-nat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Network Address Translation</a> (NAT) ranges 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, and 172.16.0.0/12. These ranges allow multiple devices in a private network to access the Internet using a single public IP address, and if you run any kind of home or office network, your internal address space operates within one or more of these NAT ranges.</p>\n<p>However, Brundage discovered that the people operating Kimwolf had figured out how to talk directly to devices on the internal networks of millions of residential proxy endpoints, simply by changing their <strong>Domain Name System</strong> (DNS) settings to match those in the RFC-1918 address ranges.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is possible to circumvent existing domain restrictions by using DNS records that point to 192.168.0.1 or 0.0.0.0,&#8221; Brundage wrote in a first-of-its-kind security advisory sent to nearly a dozen residential proxy providers in mid-December 2025. &#8220;This grants an attacker the ability to send carefully crafted requests to the current device or a device on the local network. This is actively being exploited, with attackers leveraging this functionality to drop malware.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As with the digital photo frames mentioned above, many of these residential proxy services run solely on mobile devices that are running some game, VPN or other app with a hidden component that turns the user&#8217;s mobile phone into a residential proxy &#8212; often without any meaningful consent.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://synthient.com/blog/a-broken-system-fueling-botnets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a report published today</a>, Synthient said key actors involved in Kimwolf were observed monetizing the botnet through app installs, selling residential proxy bandwidth, and selling its DDoS functionality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Synthient expects to observe a growing interest among threat actors in gaining unrestricted access to proxy networks to infect devices, obtain network access, or access sensitive information,&#8221; the report observed. &#8220;Kimwolf highlights the risks posed by unsecured proxy networks and their viability as an attack vector.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>ANDROID DEBUG BRIDGE</h2>\n<p>After purchasing a number of unofficial Android TV box models that were most heavily represented in the Kimwolf botnet, Brundage further discovered the proxy service vulnerability was only part of the reason for Kimwolf&#8217;s rapid rise: He also found virtually all of the devices he tested were shipped from the factory with a powerful feature called <strong>Android Debug Bridge</strong> (ADB) mode enabled by default.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72951\" style=\"width: 661px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72951\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72951\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/china-overseasuseonly.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"651\" height=\"611\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72951\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Many of the unofficial Android TV boxes infected by Kimwolf include the ominous disclaimer: &#8220;Made in China.

However, shipping these devices with ADB turned on creates a security nightmare because in this state they constantly listen for and accept unauthenticated connection requests.</p>\n<p>For example, opening a command prompt and typing &#8220;adb connect&#8221; along with a vulnerable device&#8217;s (local) IP address followed immediately by &#8220;:5555&#8221; will very quickly offer unrestricted &#8220;super user&#8221; administrative access.</p>\n<p>Brundage said by early December, he&#8217;d identified a one-to-one overlap between new Kimwolf infections and proxy IP addresses offered for rent by China-based <strong>IPIDEA</strong>, currently the world&#8217;s largest residential proxy network by all accounts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kimwolf has almost doubled in size this past week, just by exploiting IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy pool,&#8221; Brundage told KrebsOnSecurity in early December as he was preparing to notify IPIDEA and 10 other proxy providers about his research.</p>\n<p>Brundage said Synthient first confirmed on December 1, 2025 that the Kimwolf botnet operators were tunneling back through IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy network and into the local networks of systems running IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy software. The attackers dropped the malware payload by directing infected systems to visit a specific Internet address and to call out the pass phrase &#8220;<strong>krebsfiveheadindustries</strong>&#8221; in order to unlock the malicious download.</p>\n<p>On December 30, Synthient said it was tracking roughly 2 million IPIDEA addresses exploited by Kimwolf in the previous week. Brundage said he has witnessed Kimwolf rebuilding itself after one recent takedown effort targeting its control servers &#8212; from almost nothing to two million infected systems just by tunneling through proxy endpoints on IPIDEA for a couple of days.</p>\n<p>Brundage said IPIDEA has a seemingly inexhaustible supply of new proxies, <em>advertising access to more than 100 million residential proxy endpoints around the globe in the past week alone</em>. Analyzing the exposed devices that were part of IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy pool, Synthient said it found <em>more than two-thirds were Android devices that could be compromised with no authentication needed</em>.</p>\n<h2>SECURITY NOTIFICATION AND RESPONSE</h2>\n<p>After charting a tight overlap in Kimwolf-infected IP addresses and those sold by IPIDEA, Brundage was eager to make his findings public: The vulnerability had clearly been exploited for several months, although it appeared that only a handful of cybercrime actors were aware of the capability. But he also knew that going public without giving vulnerable proxy providers an opportunity to understand and patch it would only lead to more mass abuse of these services by additional cybercriminal groups.</p>\n<p>On December 17, Brundage sent a security notification to all 11 of the apparently affected proxy providers, hoping to give each at least a few weeks to acknowledge and address the core problems identified in his report before he went public. Many proxy providers who received the notification were resellers of IPIDEA that white-labeled the company&#8217;s service.</p>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity first sought comment from IPIDEA in October 2025, in reporting on a story about how the proxy network appeared to have benefitted from the rise of the <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aisuru botnet</a>, whose administrators appeared to shift from using the botnet primarily for DDoS attacks to simply installing IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy program, among others.</p>\n<p>On December 25, KrebsOnSecurity received an email from an IPIDEA employee identified only as &#8220;<strong>Oliver</strong>,&#8221; who said allegations that IPIDEA had benefitted from Aisuru&#8217;s rise were baseless.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After comprehensively verifying IP traceability records and supplier cooperation agreements, we found no association between any of our IP resources and the Aisuru botnet, nor have we received any notifications from authoritative institutions regarding our IPs being involved in malicious activities,&#8221; Oliver wrote. &#8220;In addition, for external cooperation, we implement a three-level review mechanism for suppliers, covering qualification verification, resource legality authentication and continuous dynamic monitoring, to ensure no compliance risks throughout the entire cooperation process.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;IPIDEA firmly opposes all forms of unfair competition and malicious smearing in the industry, always participates in market competition with compliant operation and honest cooperation, and also calls on the entire industry to jointly abandon irregular and unethical behaviors and build a clean and fair market ecosystem,&#8221; Oliver continued.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the same day that Oliver&#8217;s email arrived, Brundage shared a response he&#8217;d just received from IPIDEA&#8217;s security officer, who identified himself only by the first name <strong>Byron</strong>. The security officer said IPIDEA had made a number of important security changes to its residential proxy service to address the vulnerability identified in Brundage&#8217;s report.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By design, the proxy service does not allow access to any internal or local address space,&#8221; Byron explained. &#8220;This issue was traced to a legacy module used solely for testing and debugging purposes, which did not fully inherit the internal network access restrictions. Under specific conditions, this module could be abused to reach internal resources. The affected paths have now been fully blocked and the module has been taken offline.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Byron told Brundage IPIDEA also instituted multiple mitigations for blocking DNS resolution to internal (NAT) IP ranges, and that it was now blocking proxy endpoints from forwarding traffic on &#8220;high-risk&#8221; ports &#8220;to prevent abuse of the service for scanning, lateral movement, or access to internal services.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72905\" style=\"width: 759px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ipidea-byron.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72905\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-72905\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ipidea-byron.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"366\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ipidea-byron.png 1168w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ipidea-byron-768x375.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ipidea-byron-782x382.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72905\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An excerpt from an email sent by IPIDEA&#8217;s security officer in response to Brundage&#8217;s vulnerability notification.

The researchers noted that “the infection of a node enables the 911S5 user to access shared resources on the network such as local intranet portals or other services.”</p>\n<p>“It also enables the end user to probe the LAN network of the infected node,” the researchers <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220715000000*/https://gric.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/rpaas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explained</a>. “Using the internal router, it would be possible to poison the DNS cache of the LAN router of the infected node, enabling further attacks.”</p>\n<p>911S5 initially responded to our reporting in 2022 by claiming it was conducting a top-down security review of the service. But the proxy service abruptly closed up shop just one week later, saying a malicious hacker had destroyed all of the company&#8217;s customer and payment records. In July 2024, The <strong>U.S. Department of the Treasury</strong> <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/treasury-sanctions-creators-of-911-s5-proxy-botnet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sanctioned the alleged creators of 911S5</a>, and the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> arrested the Chinese national named in my 2022 profile of the proxy service.</p>\n<p>Kilmer said IPIDEA also operates a sister service called <strong>922 Proxy</strong>, which the company has pitched from Day One as a seamless alternative to 911S5 Proxy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You cannot tell me they don&#8217;t want the 911 customers by calling it that,&#8221; Kilmer said.</p>\n<p>Among the recipients of Synthient&#8217;s notification was the proxy giant <strong>Oxylabs</strong>. Brundage shared an email he received from Oxylabs&#8217; security team on December 31, which acknowledged Oxylabs had started rolling out security modifications to address the vulnerabilities described in Synthient&#8217;s report.</p>\n<p>Reached for comment, Oxylabs confirmed they &#8220;have implemented changes that now eliminate the ability to bypass the blocklist and forward requests to private network addresses using a controlled domain.&#8221; But it said there is no evidence that Kimwolf or other other attackers exploited its network.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In parallel, we reviewed the domains identified in the reported exploitation activity and did not observe traffic associated with them,&#8221; the Oxylabs statement continued. &#8220;Based on this review, there is no indication that our residential network was impacted by these activities.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS</h2>\n<p>Consider the following scenario, in which the mere act of allowing someone to use your Wi-Fi network could lead to a Kimwolf botnet infection. In this example, a friend or family member comes to stay with you for a few days, and you grant them access to your Wi-Fi without knowing that their mobile phone is infected with an app that turns the device into a residential proxy node. At that point, your home&#8217;s public IP address will show up for rent at the website of some residential proxy provider.</p>\n<p>Miscreants like those behind Kimwolf then use residential proxy services online to access that proxy node on your IP, tunnel back through it and into your local area network (LAN), and automatically scan the internal network for devices with Android Debug Bridge mode turned on.</p>\n<p>By the time your guest has packed up their things, said their goodbyes and disconnected from your Wi-Fi, you now have two devices on your local network &#8212; a digital photo frame and an unsanctioned Android TV box &#8212; that are infected with Kimwolf. You may have never intended for these devices to be exposed to the larger Internet, and yet there you are.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s another possible nightmare scenario: Attackers use their access to proxy networks to modify your Internet router&#8217;s settings so that it relies on malicious DNS servers controlled by the attackers &#8212; allowing them to control where your Web browser goes when it requests a website. Think that&#8217;s far-fetched? Recall the <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/dnschanger-trojan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DNSChanger malware from 2012</a> that infected more than a half-million routers with search-hijacking malware, and ultimately spawned an entire security industry working group focused on containing and eradicating it.</p>\n<h2>XLAB</h2>\n<p>Much of what is published so far on Kimwolf has come from the Chinese security firm <strong>XLab</strong>, which was the first to <a href=\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chronicle the rise of the Aisuru botnet</a> in late 2024. In <a href=\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/kimwolf-botnet-en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">its latest blog post</a>, XLab said it began tracking Kimwolf on October 24, when the botnet&#8217;s control servers were swamping Cloudflare&#8217;s DNS servers with lookups for the distinctive domain 14emeliaterracewestroxburyma02132[.]su.</p>\n<p>This domain and others connected to early Kimwolf variants spent several weeks <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/cloudflare-scrubs-aisuru-botnet-from-top-domains-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">topping Cloudflare&#8217;s chart of the Internet&#8217;s most sought-after domains</a>, edging out Google.com and Apple.com of their rightful spots in the top 5 most-requested domains. That&#8217;s because during that time Kimwolf was asking its millions of bots to check in frequently using Cloudflare&#8217;s DNS servers.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72954\" style=\"width: 757px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72954\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-72954\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xlab-countrykimwolf.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"747\" height=\"798\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72954\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Chinese security firm XLab found the Kimwolf botnet had enslaved between 1.8 and 2 million devices, with heavy concentrations in Brazil, India, The United States of America and Argentina. Image: blog.xLab.qianxin.com</p></div>\n<p>It is clear from reading the XLab report that KrebsOnSecurity (and security experts) probably erred in <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/cloudflare-scrubs-aisuru-botnet-from-top-domains-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">misattributing some of Kimwolf&#8217;s early activities</a> to the Aisuru botnet, which appears to be operated by a different group entirely. IPDEA may have been truthful when it said it had no affiliation with the Aisuru botnet, but Brundage&#8217;s data left no doubt that its proxy service clearly was being massively abused by Aisuru&#8217;s Android variant, Kimwolf.</p>\n<p>XLab said Kimwolf has infected at least 1.8 million devices, and has shown it is able to rebuild itself quickly from scratch.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Analysis indicates that Kimwolf&#8217;s primary infection targets are TV boxes deployed in residential network environments,&#8221; XLab researchers wrote. &#8220;Since residential networks usually adopt dynamic IP allocation mechanisms, the public IPs of devices change over time, so the true scale of infected devices cannot be accurately measured solely by the quantity of IPs. In other words, the cumulative observation of 2.7 million IP addresses does not equate to 2.7 million infected devices.&#8221;</p>\n<p>XLab said measuring Kimwolf&#8217;s size also is difficult because infected devices are distributed across multiple global time zones. &#8220;Affected by time zone differences and usage habits (e.g., turning off devices at night, not using TV boxes during holidays, etc.), these devices are not online simultaneously, further increasing the difficulty of comprehensive observation through a single time window,&#8221; the blog post observed.</p>\n<p>XLab noted that the Kimwolf author shows an almost &#8216;obsessive&#8217; fixation&#8221; on Yours Truly, apparently leaving &#8220;easter eggs&#8221; related to my name in multiple places through the botnet&#8217;s code and communications:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72955\" style=\"width: 745px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72955\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-72955\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xlab-kimwolfk.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"735\" height=\"702\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72955\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image: XLAB.</p></div>\n<h2>ANALYSIS AND ADVICE</h2>\n<p>One frustrating aspect of threats like Kimwolf is that in most cases it is not easy for the average user to determine if there are any devices on their internal network which may be vulnerable to threats like Kimwolf and/or already infected with residential proxy malware.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s assume that through years of security training or some dark magic you can successfully identify that residential proxy activity on your internal network was linked to a specific mobile device inside your house: From there, you&#8217;d still need to isolate and remove the app or unwanted component that is turning the device into a residential proxy.</p>\n<p>Also, the tooling and knowledge needed to achieve this kind of visibility just isn&#8217;t there from an average consumer standpoint. The work that it takes to configure your network so you can see and interpret logs of all traffic coming in and out is largely beyond the skillset of most Internet users (and, I&#8217;d wager, many security experts). But it&#8217;s a topic worth exploring in an upcoming story.</p>\n<p>Happily, Synthient has erected <a href=\"https://synthient.com/check\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a page on its website</a> that will state whether a visitor&#8217;s public Internet address was seen among those of Kimwolf-infected systems. Brundage also has compiled <a href=\"https://github.com/synthient/public-research/blob/main/2026/01/kimwolf/product_devices.csv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a list of the unofficial Android TV boxes</a> that are most highly represented in the Kimwolf botnet.</p>\n<p>If you own a TV box that matches one of these model names and/or numbers, please just rip it out of your network. If you encounter one of these devices on the network of a family member or friend, send them a link to this story and explain that it&#8217;s not worth the potential hassle and harm created by keeping them plugged in.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72953\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72953\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-72953\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/synthient-topproductdevices.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"372\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/synthient-topproductdevices.png 1513w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/synthient-topproductdevices-768x381.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/synthient-topproductdevices-782x388.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72953\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The top 15 product devices represented in the Kimwolf botnet, according to Synthient.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Chad Seaman</strong> is a principal security researcher with <strong>Akamai Technologies</strong>. Seaman said he wants more consumers to be wary of these pseudo Android TV boxes to the point where they avoid them altogether.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want the consumer to be paranoid of these crappy devices and of these residential proxy schemes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We need to highlight why they&#8217;re dangerous to everyone and to the individual. The whole security model where people think their LAN (Local Internal Network) is safe, that there aren&#8217;t any bad guys on the LAN so it can&#8217;t be that dangerous is just really outdated now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea that an app can enable this type of abuse on my network and other networks, that should really give you pause,&#8221; about which devices to allow onto your local network, Seaman said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not just Android devices here. Some of these proxy services have SDKs for Mac and Windows, and the iPhone. It could be running something that inadvertently cracks open your network and lets countless random people inside.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In July 2025, Google filed a “John Doe” <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.643466/gov.uscourts.nysd.643466.22.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lawsuit</a> (PDF) against 25 unidentified defendants collectively dubbed the “<strong>BadBox 2.0 Enterprise</strong>,” which Google described as a botnet of over ten million unsanctioned Android streaming devices engaged in advertising fraud. Google said the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, in addition to compromising multiple types of devices prior to purchase, also can infect devices by requiring the download of malicious apps from unofficial marketplaces.</p>\n<p>Google’s lawsuit came on the heels of a <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">June 2025 advisory</a> from the <strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> (FBI), which warned that cyber criminals were gaining unauthorized access to home networks by either configuring the products with malware prior to the user’s purchase, or infecting the device as it downloads required applications that contain backdoors &#8212; usually during the set-up process.</p>\n<p>The FBI said BADBOX 2.0 was discovered after the original BADBOX campaign was disrupted in 2024. The original BADBOX was identified in 2023, and primarily consisted of Android operating system devices that were compromised with backdoor malware prior to purchase.</p>\n<p><strong>Lindsay Kaye</strong> is vice president of threat intelligence at <strong>HUMAN Security</strong>, a company that worked closely on the BADBOX investigations. Kaye said the BADBOX botnets and the residential proxy networks that rode on top of compromised devices were detected because they enabled a ridiculous amount of advertising fraud, as well as ticket scalping, retail fraud, account takeovers and content scraping.</p>\n<p>Kaye said consumers should stick to known brands when it comes to purchasing things that require a wired or wireless connection.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If people are asking what they can do to avoid being victimized by proxies, it&#8217;s safest to stick with name brands,&#8221; Kaye said. &#8220;Anything promising something for free or low-cost, or giving you something for nothing just isn&#8217;t worth it. And be careful about what apps you allow on your phone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many wireless routers these days make it relatively easy to deploy a &#8220;Guest&#8221; wireless network on-the-fly. Doing so allows your guests to browse the Internet just fine but it blocks their device from being able to talk to other devices on the local network &#8212; such as shared folders, printers and drives. If someone &#8212; a friend, family member, or contractor &#8212; requests access to your network, give them the guest Wi-Fi network credentials if you have that option.</p>\n<p>There is a small but vocal pro-piracy camp that is almost condescendingly dismissive of the security threats posed by these unsanctioned Android TV boxes. These tech purists positively chafe at the idea of people wholesale discarding one of these TV boxes. A common refrain from this camp is that Internet-connected devices are not inherently bad or good, and that even factory-infected boxes can be flashed with new firmware or custom ROMs that contain no known dodgy software.</p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s important to point out that the majority of people buying these devices are not security or hardware experts; the devices are sought out because they dangle something of value for &#8220;free.&#8221; Most buyers have no idea of the bargain they&#8217;re making when plugging one of these dodgy TV boxes into their network.</p>\n<p>It is somewhat remarkable that we haven&#8217;t yet seen the entertainment industry applying more visible pressure on the major e-commerce vendors to stop peddling this insecure and actively malicious hardware that is largely made and marketed for video piracy. These TV boxes are a public nuisance for bundling malicious software while having no apparent security or authentication built-in, and these two qualities make them an attractive nuisance for cybercriminals.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for Part II in this series, which will poke through clues left behind by the people who appear to have built Kimwolf and benefited from it the most.</p>\n",

Experts blamed that attack on an Internet-of-Things botnet called <strong>Aisuru</strong> that had rapidly grown in size and firepower since its debut in late 2024. Another Aisuru attack on Cloudflare just days later practically doubled the size of the June attack against this website. Not long after that, Aisuru was blamed for a DDoS that again doubled the previous record.</p>\n<p>In October, it appeared the cybercriminals in control of Aisuru had shifted the botnet&#8217;s focus from DDoS to a more sustainable and profitable use: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic</a>.</p>\n<p>However, it has recently become clear that at least some of the disruptive botnet and residential proxy activity attributed to Aisuru last year likely was the work of people responsible for building and testing a powerful botnet known as <strong>Kimwolf</strong>. Chinese security firm <strong>XLab, </strong>which was the first to chronicle Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024, <a href=\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/kimwolf-botnet-en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently profiled Kimwolf</a> as easily the world&#8217;s biggest and most dangerous collection of compromised machines &#8212; with approximately 1.83 million devices under its thumb as of December 17.</p>\n<p>XLab noted that the Kimwolf author &#8220;shows an almost &#8216;obsessive&#8217; fixation on the well-known cybersecurity investigative journalist Brian Krebs, leaving easter eggs related to him in multiple places.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72917\" style=\"width: 759px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72917\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-72917\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xlabs-littlegossip.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"648\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xlabs-littlegossip.png 783w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xlabs-littlegossip-768x664.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72917\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image: XLab, Kimwolf Botnet Exposed: The Massive Android Botnet with 1.8 million infected devices.</p></div>\n<p>I am happy to report that the first KrebsOnSecurity stories of 2026 will go deep into the origins of Kimwolf, and examine the botnet&#8217;s unique and highly invasive means of spreading digital disease far and wide.

      "content": "<p>The Trump administration has pursued a staggering range of policy pivots this past year that threaten to weaken the nation&#8217;s ability and willingness to address a broad spectrum of technology challenges, from cybersecurity and privacy to countering disinformation, fraud and corruption. These shifts, along with the president&#8217;s efforts to restrict free speech and freedom of the press, have come at such a rapid clip that many readers probably aren&#8217;t even aware of them all.</p>\n<h2>FREE SPEECH</h2>\n<p>President Trump has repeatedly claimed that a primary reason he lost the 2020 election was that social media and Big Tech companies had conspired to silence conservative voices and stifle free speech. Naturally, the president&#8217;s impulse in his second term has been to use the levers of the federal government in an effort to limit the speech of everyday Americans, as well as foreigners wishing to visit the United States.</p>\n<p>In September, Donald Trump signed a national security directive known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSPM-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NSPM-7</a>, which directs federal law enforcement officers and intelligence analysts to target &#8220;anti-American&#8221; activity, including any &#8220;tax crimes&#8221; involving extremist groups who defrauded the IRS. According to <a href=\"https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/leak-fbi-list-of-extremists-is-coming?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">extensive reporting</a> by journalist <strong>Ken Klippenstein</strong>, the focus of the order is on those expressing &#8220;opposition to law and immigration enforcement; extreme views in favor of mass migration and open borders; adherence to radical gender ideology,&#8221; as well as &#8220;anti-Americanism,&#8221; &#8220;anti-capitalism,&#8221; and &#8220;anti-Christianity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, <strong>Attorney General Pam Bondi</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3915104/bondi-orders-fbi-launch-cash-reward-system-reporting-alleged-domestic-terrorists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issued a memo</a> advising the FBI to compile a list of Americans whose activities &#8220;may constitute domestic terrorism.&#8221; Bondi also ordered the FBI to establish a &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-12-11/justice-department-drafting-list-of-domestic-terrorists\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cash reward system</a>&#8221; to encourage the public to report suspected domestic terrorist activity. The memo states that domestic terrorism could include &#8220;opposition to law and immigration enforcement&#8221; or support for &#8220;radical gender ideology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Trump administration also is planning to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/us-to-inspect-tourists-social-media-history-from-past-5-years-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">impose social media restrictions</a> on tourists as the president continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors. According to <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/12/10/2025-22461/agency-information-collection-activities-revision-arrival-and-departure-record-form-i-94-and\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a notice</a> from <strong>U.S. Customs and Border Protection</strong> (CBP), tourists &#8212; including those from Britain, Australia, France, and Japan &#8212; will soon be required to provide five years of their social media history.</p>\n<p>The CBP said it will also collect &#8220;several high value data fields,&#8221; including applicants&#8217; email addresses from the past 10 years, their telephone numbers used in the past five years, and names and details of family members. Wired <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cbp-searched-a-record-number-of-phones-at-the-us-border-over-the-past-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> in October that the US CBP executed more device searches at the border in the first three months of the year than any other previous quarter.</p>\n<p>The new requirements from CBP add meat to the bones of <strong>Executive Order 14161</strong>, which in the name of combating &#8220;foreign terrorist and public safety threats&#8221; granted broad new authority that civil rights groups warn could enable a renewed travel ban and expanded visa denials or deportations based on perceived ideology. Critics alleged the order&#8217;s vague language around &#8220;public safety threats,&#8221; creates latitude for targeting individuals based on political views, national origin, or religion. At least 35 nations are now <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/16/us/politics/trump-expanded-travel-ban.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">under some form of U.S. travel restrictions</a>.</p>\n<h2>CRIME AND CORRUPTION</h2>\n<p>In February, Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/pausing-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-enforcement-to-further-american-economic-and-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ordered</a> executive branch agencies to stop enforcing the <strong>U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</strong>, which froze foreign bribery investigations, and even allows for “remedial actions” of past enforcement actions deemed “inappropriate.”</p>\n<p>The White House also disbanded the <strong>Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative</strong> and <strong>KleptoCapture Task Force</strong> — units which proved their value in corruption cases and in seizing the assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs — and diverted resources away from investigating white-collar crime.</p>\n<p>Also in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/doj-disbands-foreign-influence-task-force/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dissolved</a> the FBI&#8217;s <strong>Foreign Influence Task Force</strong>, an entity created during Trump&#8217;s first term designed to counter the influence of foreign governments on American politics.</p>\n<p>In March 2025, Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-suspends-some-efforts-counter-russian-sabotage-trump-moves-closer-putin-2025-03-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> that several U.S. national security agencies had halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks. Former President Joe Biden had ordered his national security team to establish working groups to monitor the issue amid warnings from U.S. intelligence that Russia was escalating a shadow war against Western nations.</p>\n<p>In a test of prosecutorial independence, Trump&#8217;s Justice Department ordered prosecutors to drop the corruption case against New York Mayor <strong>Eric Adams</strong>. The fallout was immediate: Multiple senior officials resigned in protest, the case was reassigned, and chaos engulfed the Southern District of New York (SDNY) &#8211; historically one of the nation&#8217;s most aggressive offices for pursuing public corruption, white-collar crime, and cybercrime cases.</p>\n<p>When it comes to cryptocurrency, the administration has shifted regulators at the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC) away from enforcement to cheerleading an industry that has consistently been plagued by scams, fraud and rug-pulls. The SEC in 2025 systematically retreated from enforcement against cryptocurrency operators, dropping major cases against <strong>Coinbase</strong>, <strong>Binance</strong>, and others.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most troubling example involves <strong>Justin Sun</strong>, the Chinese-born founder of crypto currency company <strong>Tron</strong>. In 2023, the SEC charged Sun with fraud and market manipulation. Sun subsequently invested $75 million in the Trump family&#8217;s <strong>World Liberty Financial</strong> (WLF) tokens, became the top holder of the $TRUMP memecoin, and secured a seat at an exclusive dinner with the president.</p>\n<p>In late February 2025, the SEC dropped its lawsuit. Sun promptly took Tron public through a reverse merger arranged by Dominari Securities, a firm with Trump family ties. Democratic lawmakers have urged the SEC to investigate what they call &#8220;concerning ties to President Trump and his family&#8221; as potential conflicts of interest and foreign influence.</p>\n<p>In October, President Trump pardoned <strong>Changpeng Zhao</strong>, the founder of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange <strong>Binance</strong>. In 2023, Zhao and his company pled guilty to failing to prevent money laundering on the platform. Binance paid a $4 billion fine, and Zhao served a four-month sentence. As <strong>CBS News</strong> observed last month, shortly after Zhao&#8217;s pardon application, he was at the center of a blockbuster deal that put the Trump&#8217;s family&#8217;s WLF on the map.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Zhao is a citizen of the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf and in May, an Emirati fund put $2 billion in Zhao&#8217;s Binance,&#8221; 60 Minutes <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pardon-of-crypto-billionaire-sparks-concerns-over-use-of-pardon-power-60-minutes-transcript/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>. &#8220;Of all the currencies in the world, the deal was done in World Liberty crypto.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>SEC Chairman</strong> <strong>Paul Atkins</strong> has made the agency&#8217;s new posture towards crypto explicit, stating &#8220;most crypto tokens are not securities.&#8221; At the same time, President Trump has directed the <strong>Department of Labor</strong> and the SEC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62w8ewg849o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to expand 401(k) access to private equity and crypto</a> &#8212; assets that regulators have historically restricted for retail investors due to high risk, fees, opacity, and illiquidity. The executive order explicitly prioritizes &#8220;curbing ERISA litigation,&#8221; and reducing accountability for fiduciaries while shifting risk onto ordinary workers&#8217; retirement savings.</p>\n<p>At the White House&#8217;s behest, the U.S. Treasury in March <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0038\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suspended</a> the <strong>Corporate Transparency Act</strong>, a law that required companies to reveal their real owners. Finance experts warned the suspension would bring back shell companies and &#8220;<a href=\"https://thefactcoalition.org/treasury-reopens-the-floodgates-to-dirty-money-cta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">open the flood gates of dirty money</a>&#8221; through the US, such as funds from drug gangs, human traffickers, and fraud groups.</p>\n<p>Trump&#8217;s clemency decisions have created a pattern of freed criminals committing new offenses, including <strong>Jonathan Braun</strong>, whose sentence for drug trafficking was commuted during Trump&#8217;s first term, was found guilty in 2025 of violating supervised release and faces new charges.</p>\n<p><strong>Eliyahu Weinstein</strong>, who received a commutation in January 2021 for running a Ponzi scheme, was sentenced in November 2025 to 37 years for running a new Ponzi scheme. The administration has also granted clemency to a growing list of white-collar criminals: <strong>David Gentile</strong>, a private equity executive sentenced to seven years for securities and wire fraud (functionally a ponzi-like scheme), and <strong>Trevor Milton</strong>, the Nikola founder sentenced to four years for defrauding investors over electric vehicle technology. The message: Financial crimes against ordinary investors are no big deal.</p>\n<p>At least 10 of the January 6 insurrectionists pardoned by President Trump <a href=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/at-least-10-pardoned-insurrectionists-face-other-criminal-charges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have already been rearrested, charged or sentenced for other crimes</a>, including plotting the murder of FBI agents, child sexual assault, possession of child sexual abuse material and reckless homicide while driving drunk.</p>\n<p>The administration also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-threatens-new-icc-sanctions-unless-court-pledges-not-prosecute-trump-2025-12-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">imposed sanctions</a> against the <strong>International Criminal Court</strong> (ICC). On February 6, 2025, Executive Order 14203 authorized asset freezes and visa restrictions against ICC officials investigating U.S. citizens or allies, primarily in response to the ICC&#8217;s arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month the president launched the &#8220;<strong>Gold Card</strong>,&#8221; a visa scheme established by an executive order in September that offers wealthy individuals and corporations expedited paths to U.S. residency and citizenship <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q1lddj8go\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in exchange for $1 million for individuals and $2 million for companies</a>, plus ongoing fees. The administration says it is also planning to offer a &#8220;platinum&#8221; version of the card that offers special tax breaks &#8212; for a cool $5 million.<span id=\"more-72706\"></span></p>\n<h2>FEDERAL CYBERSECURITY</h2>\n<p>President Trump campaigned for a second term insisting that the previous election was riddled with fraud and had been stolen from him. Shortly after Mr. Trump took the oath of office for a second time, he fired the head of the <strong>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</strong> (CISA) &#8212; <strong>Chris Krebs</strong> (no relation) &#8212; for having the audacity to state publicly that the 2020 election was the most secure in U.S. history.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump revoked Krebs&#8217;s security clearances, ordered a Justice Department investigation into his election security work, and suspended the security clearances of employees at <strong>SentinelOne</strong>, the cybersecurity firm where Krebs worked as chief intelligence and public policy officer. The executive order was the first direct presidential action against any US cybersecurity company. Krebs subsequently resigned from SentinelOne, telling The Wall Street Journal he was leaving to push back on Trump&#8217;s efforts &#8220;to go after corporate interests and corporate relationships.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The president also dismissed all 15 members of the <strong>Cyber Safety Review Board </strong>(CSRB), a nonpartisan government entity established in 2022 with a mandate to investigate the security failures behind major cybersecurity events &#8212; likely because those advisors included Chris Krebs.</p>\n<p>At the time, the CSRB was in the middle of compiling a much-anticipated report on the root causes of Chinese government-backed digital intrusions into at least nine U.S. telecommunications providers. Not to be outdone, the <strong>Federal Communication Commission </strong>quickly moved to <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fcc-rolls-back-cybersecurity-rules-for-telcos-despite-state-hacking-risks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">roll back a previous ruling</a> that required U.S. telecom carriers to implement stricter cybersecurity measures.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, CISA has lost roughly a third of its workforce this year amid mass layoffs and deferred resignations. When the government shutdown began in October, CISA laid off even more employees and furloughed 65 percent of the remaining staff, leaving <a href=\"https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/federal-shutdown-deal-revives-key-cisa-grant-some-staffing-a-30004\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">only 900 employees</a> working without pay.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security has reassigned CISA cyber specialists to jobs supporting the president&#8217;s deportation agenda. As <strong>Bloomberg</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-08/homeland-security-cyber-personnel-reassigned-to-jobs-in-trump-s-deportation-push\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> earlier this year, CISA employees were given a week to accept the new roles or resign, and some of the reassignments included relocations to new geographic areas.</p>\n<p>The White House has signaled that it plans to <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/trump-cisa-budget-cuts-disinformation/747047/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cut an additional $491 million from CISA&#8217;s budget next year</a>, cuts that primarily target CISA programs focused on international affairs and countering misinformation and foreign propaganda. The president&#8217;s budget proposal justified the cuts by repeating debunked claims about CISA engaging in censorship.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has pursued a similar reorganization at the FBI: <strong>The Washington Post</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/08/fbi-agents-reassigned-immigration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported in October</a> that a quarter of all FBI agents have now been reassigned from national security threats to immigration enforcement. Reuters reported last week that the replacement of seasoned leaders at the FBI and Justice Department with Trump loyalists has led to an unprecedented number of prosecutorial missteps, resulting in a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/unprecedented-errors-are-eroding-credibility-trumps-justice-department-2025-12-17/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">21 percent dismissal rate</a> of the D.C. U.S. attorney&#8217;s office criminal complaints over eight weeks, compared to a mere .5% dismissal rate over the prior 10 years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These mistakes are causing department attorneys to lose credibility with federal courts, with some judges quashing subpoenas, threatening criminal contempt and issuing opinions that raise questions about their conduct,&#8221; Reuters reported. &#8220;Grand juries have also in some cases started rejecting indictments, a highly unusual event since prosecutors control what evidence gets presented.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In August, the DHS <a href=\"https://statescoop.com/state-local-cyber-grant-msisac-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banned state and local governments from using cyber grants</a> on services provided by the <strong>Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center</strong> (MS-ISAC), a group that for more than 20 years has shared critical cybersecurity intelligence across state lines and provided software and other resources at free or heavily discounted rates. Specifically, DHS barred states from spending funds on services offered by the <strong>Elections Infrastructure ISAC</strong>, which was <a href=\"https://statescoop.com/federal-cuts-election-security-secretaries-state-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">effectively shuttered</a> after DHS pulled its funding in February.</p>\n<p><strong>Cybersecurity Dive</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity-partnerships-disruption-trump-government-industry/751589/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports</a> that the Trump administration&#8217;s massive workforce cuts, along with widespread mission uncertainty and a persistent leadership void, have interrupted federal agencies&#8217; efforts to collaborate with the businesses and local utilities that run and protect healthcare facilities, water treatment plans, energy companies and telecommunications networks. The publication said the changes came after the US government eliminated <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-08/CIPAC_FAQ_2021_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CIPAC</a> &#8212; a framework that allowed private companies to share cyber and threat intel without legal penalties.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Government leaders have canceled meetings with infrastructure operators, forced out their longtime points of contact, stopped attending key industry events and scrapped a coordination program that made companies feel comfortable holding sensitive talks about cyberattacks and other threats with federal agencies,&#8221; Cybersecurity Dive&#8217;s <strong>Eric Geller</strong> wrote.</p>\n<p>Both the <strong>National Security Agency</strong> (NSA) and <strong>U.S. Cyber Command</strong> have been without a leader since Trump dismissed <strong>Air Force General Timothy Haugh</strong> in April, allegedly for disloyalty to the president and at the suggestion of far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer. The nomination of Army Lt. Gen. William Hartman for the same position fell through in October. The White House has <a href=\"https://news.risky.biz/r/653e0b9e?m=ebb10ba8-118c-4ebb-aa1e-761703373571\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ordered the NSA to cut 8 percent of its civilian workforce</a> (between 1,500 and 2,000 employees).</p>\n<p>As <strong>The Associated Press</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/gabbard-announces-40-cut-to-workforce-at-key-u-s-intelligence-office\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> in August, the <strong>Office of the Director of National Intelligence</strong> plans to dramatically reduce its workforce and cut its budget by more than $700 million annually. Director of National Intelligence <strong>Tulsi Gabbard</strong> said the cuts were warranted because ODNI had become &#8220;bloated and inefficient, and the intelligence community is rife with abuse of power, unauthorized leaks of classified intelligence, and politicized weaponization of intelligence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The firing or forced retirements of so many federal employees has been a boon to foreign intelligence agencies. Chinese intelligence agencies, for example, <a href=\"https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2025/05/16/fdd-uncovers-likely-chinese-intelligence-operation-targeting-recently-laid-off-u-s-government-employees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly</a> moved quickly to take advantage of the mass layoffs, using a network of front companies to recruit laid-off U.S. government employees for &#8220;consulting work.&#8221; Former workers with the Defense Department&#8217;s <strong>Defense Digital Service</strong> who resigned en-masse earlier this year thanks to DOGE encroaching on their mission <a href=\"https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/uae-recruiting-us-personnel-displaced-by-doge-to-work-on-ai-for-its-military/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have been approached</a> by the United Arab Emirates to work on artificial intelligence for the oil kingdom&#8217;s armed forces, albeit reportedly with the blessing of the Trump administration.</p>\n<h2>PRESS FREEDOM</h2>\n<p>President Trump has filed multibillion-dollar lawsuits <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/timeline-trumps-fights-media-including-bbc-jimmy-kimmel-128441164\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">against a number of major news outlets</a> over news segments or interviews that allegedly portrayed him in a negative light, suing the networks <strong>ABC</strong>, the <strong>BBC</strong>, the <strong>CBS</strong> parent company <strong>Paramount</strong>, <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong>, and <strong>The New York Times</strong>, among others.</p>\n<p>The president signed an executive order aimed at slashing public subsidies to <strong>PBS</strong> and <strong>NPR</strong>, alleging &#8220;bias&#8221; in the broadcasters&#8217; reporting. In July, Congress approved a request from Trump to cut $1.1 billion in federal funding for the <strong>Corporation for Public Broadcasting</strong>, the nonprofit entity that funds PBS and NPR.</p>\n<p><strong>Brendan Carr</strong>, the president’s pick to run the <strong>Federal Communications Commission</strong> (FCC), initially pledged to “dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.” But on January 22, 2025, the FCC reopened complaints against ABC, CBS and <strong>NBC</strong> over their coverage of the 2024 election. The previous FCC chair had dismissed the complaints as attacks on the First Amendment and an attempt to weaponize the agency for political purposes.</p>\n<p>President Trump in February <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/trump-white-house-press-pool-access-00206001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seized control</a> of the <strong>White House Correspondents&#8217; Association</strong>, the nonprofit entity that decides which media outlets should have access to the White House and the press pool that follows the president. The president invited an additional 32 media outlets, mostly conservative or right-wing organizations.</p>\n<p>According to the journalism group <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2025/white-house-press-pool-new-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Poynter.org</a>, there are three religious networks, all of which lean conservative, as well as a mix of outlets that includes a legacy paper, television networks, and a digital outlet powered by artificial intelligence.  Trump also barred <strong>The Associated Press</strong> from the White House over their refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.</p>\n<p>Under Trump appointee <strong>Kari Lake</strong>, the <strong>U.S. Agency for Global Media</strong> moved to dismantle <strong>Voice of America</strong>, <strong>Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty</strong>, and other networks that for decades served as credible news sources behind authoritarian lines. Courts blocked shutdown orders, but the damage continues through administrative leave, contract terminations, and funding disputes.</p>\n<p>President Trump this term has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/opm-privacy-team-fired/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fired most of the people</a> involved in processing <strong>Freedom of Information Act</strong> (FOIA) requests for government agencies. FOIA is an indispensable tool used by journalists and the public to request government records, and to hold leaders accountable.</p>\n<p>Petitioning the government, particularly when it ignores your requests, often requires challenging federal agencies in court. But that becomes far more difficult if the most competent law firms start to shy away from cases that may involve crossing the president and his administration. On March 22, the president issued <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preventing-abuses-of-the-legal-system-and-the-federal-court/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a memorandum</a> that directs heads of the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to “seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the United States,” or in matters that come before federal agencies.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration announced <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-orders-enhanced-vetting-applicants-h-1b-visa-2025-12-04/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increased vetting of applicants for H-1B visas</a> for highly skilled workers, with an internal State Department memo saying that anyone involved in &#8220;censorship&#8221; of free speech should be considered for rejection.</p>\n<p><strong>Executive Order 14161</strong>, issued in 2025 on &#8220;foreign terrorist and public safety threats,&#8221; granted broad new authority that civil rights groups warn could enable a renewed travel ban and expanded visa denials or deportations based on perceived ideology. Critics charged that the order&#8217;s vague language around &#8220;public safety threats&#8221; creates latitude for targeting individuals based on political views, national origin, or religion.</p>\n<h2>CONSUMER PROTECTION, PRIVACY</h2>\n<p>At the beginning of this year, President Trump ordered staffers at the <strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</strong> (CFPB) to stop most work. Created by Congress in 2011 to be a clearinghouse of consumer complaints, the CFPB has sued some of the nation’s largest financial institutions for violating consumer protection laws. The CFPB says its actions have put nearly $18 billion back in Americans’ pockets in the form of monetary compensation or canceled debts, and imposed $4 billion in civil money penalties against violators.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration said it planned to fire up to 90 percent of all CFPB staff, but a recent federal appeals court ruling in Washington tossed out an earlier decision that would have allowed the firings to proceed. Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-appeals-court-tosses-decision-allowing-trump-mass-firings-consumer-bureau-2025-12-17/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported this week</a> that an employee union and others have battled against it in court for ten months, during which the agency has been almost completely idled.</p>\n<p>The CFPB&#8217;s acting director is <strong>Russell Vought</strong>, a key architect of the GOP policy framework Project 2025. Under Vought&#8217;s direction, the CFPB in May <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-quietly-kills-rule-to-shield-americans-from-data-brokers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quietly withdrew a data broker protection rule</a> intended to limit the ability of U.S. data brokers to sell personal information on Americans.</p>\n<p>Despite the Federal Reserve&#8217;s own post-mortem <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/04/28/1172715215/silicon-valley-bank-postmortem-federal-reserve-fdic-signature-bank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explicitly blaming Trump-era deregulation</a> for the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse, which triggered a fast-moving crisis requiring emergency weekend bailouts of banks, Trump&#8217;s banking regulators in 2025 doubled down. They loosened capital requirements, narrowed definitions of &#8220;unsafe&#8221; banking practices, and stripped specific risk categories from supervisory frameworks. The setup for another banking crisis requiring taxpayer intervention is now in place.</p>\n<p>The Privacy Act of 1974, one of the few meaningful federal privacy laws, was built on the principles of consent and separation in response to the abuses of power that came to light during the Watergate era. The law states that when an individual provides personal information to a federal agency to receive a particular service, that data must be used <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-trump-administration-is-using-americans-sensitive-data-to-build-a-digital-watchtower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">solely for its original purpose</a>.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it emerged in June that the Trump administration has built a central database of all US citizens. According to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/29/nx-s1-5409608/citizenship-trump-privacy-voting-database\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NPR</a>, the White House plans to use the new platform during upcoming elections to verify the identity and citizenship status of US voters. The database was built by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Governmental Efficiency and is being rolled out in phases to US states.</p>\n<h2>DOGE</h2>\n<p>Probably the biggest ungotten scoop of 2025 is the inside story of what happened to all of the personal, financial and other sensitive data that was accessed by workers at the so-called <strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong> (DOGE). President Trump tapped <strong>Elon Musk</strong> to lead the newly created department, which was mostly populated by current and former employees of Musk&#8217;s various technology companies (including <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/teen-on-musks-doge-team-graduated-from-the-com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a former denizen of the cybercrime community known as the &#8220;Com&#8221;</a>). It soon emerged that the DOGE team was using artificial intelligence <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/musks-doge-using-ai-snoop-us-federal-workers-sources-say-2025-04-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to surveil at least one federal agency&#8217;s communications</a> for hostility to Mr. Trump and his agenda.</p>\n<p>DOGE employees were able to access and synthesize data taken from a large number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act_of_1974\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">previously separate</a> and highly guarded federal databases, including those at the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Personnel Management, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. DOGE staffers did so largely by circumventing or dismantling security measures designed to detect and prevent misuse of federal databases, including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms.</p>\n<p>For example, an IT expert with the <strong>National Labor Relations Board</strong> (NLRB) <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/doge-workers-code-supports-nlrb-whistleblower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">alleges</a> that DOGE employees likely downloaded gigabytes of data from agency case files in early March, using short-lived accounts that were configured to leave few traces of network activity. The NLRB whistleblower said the large data outflows coincided with multiple blocked login attempts from addresses in Russia, which attempted to use valid credentials for a newly-created DOGE user account.</p>\n<p>The stated goal of DOGE was to reduce bureaucracy and to massively cut costs &#8212; mainly by eliminating funding for a raft of federal initiatives that had already been approved by Congress. The DOGE website claimed those efforts reduced &#8220;wasteful&#8221; and &#8220;fraudulent&#8221; federal spending by more than $200 billion. However, multiple independent reviews by news organizations determined the true &#8220;savings&#8221; DOGE achieved was off by a couple of orders of magnitude, and was likely closer to $2 billion.</p>\n<p>At the same time DOGE was slashing federal programs, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/inspectors-general-fired-by-trump-issue-warning-about-lack-of-oversight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fired at least 17 inspectors general</a> at federal agencies &#8212; the very people tasked with actually identifying and stopping waste, fraud and abuse at the federal level. Those included several agencies (such as the NLRB) that had open investigations into one or more of Mr. Musk&#8217;s companies for allegedly failing to comply with protocols aimed at protecting state secrets. In September, a federal judge found the president <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/agency-oversight/2025/09/trump-unlawfully-fired-17-agency-igs-judge-finds-but-wont-reinstate-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unlawfully fired the agency watchdogs</a>, but none of them have been reinstated.</p>\n<p>Where is DOGE now? <strong>Reuters</strong> reported last month that as far as the White House is concerned, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-doesnt-exist-with-eight-months-left-its-charter-2025-11-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DOGE no longer exists</a>, even though it technically has more than half a year left to its charter. Meanwhile, who exactly retains access to federal agency data that was fed by DOGE into AI tools is anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity would like to thank the anonymous researcher <a href=\"https://natinfosec.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NatInfoSec</a> for assisting with the research on this story.</p>\n",

Image: Infoblox.</p></div>\n<p>When Internet users try to visit expired domain names or accidentally navigate to a lookalike &#8220;typosquatting&#8221; domain, they are typically brought to a placeholder page at a domain parking company that tries to monetize the wayward traffic by displaying links to a number of third-party websites that have paid to have their links shown.</p>\n<p>A decade ago, ending up at one of these parked domains came with a relatively small chance of being redirected to a malicious destination: In 2014, researchers <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-alrwais.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">found</a> (PDF) that parked domains redirected users to malicious sites less than five percent of the time &#8212; regardless of whether the visitor clicked on any links at the parked page.</p>\n<p>But in a series of experiments over the past few months, researchers at the security firm <strong>Infoblox</strong> say they discovered the situation is now reversed, and that malicious content is by far the norm now for parked websites.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;In large scale experiments, we found that over 90% of the time, visitors to a parked domain would be directed to illegal content, scams, scareware and anti-virus software subscriptions, or malware, as the &#8216;click&#8217; was sold from the parking company to advertisers, who often resold that traffic to yet another party,&#8221; Infoblox researchers wrote in <a href=\"https://blogs.infoblox.com/threat-intelligence/parked-domains-become-weapons-with-direct-search-advertising/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a paper published today</a>.</p>\n<p>Infoblox found parked websites are benign if the visitor arrives at the site using a virtual private network (VPN), or else via a non-residential Internet address. For example, <strong>Scotiabank.com</strong> customers who accidentally mistype the domain as <strong>scotaibank[.]com</strong> will see a normal parking page if they&#8217;re using a VPN, but will be redirected to a site that tries to foist scams, malware or other unwanted content if coming from a residential IP address. Again, this redirect happens just by visiting the misspelled domain with a mobile device or desktop computer that is using a residential IP address.</p>\n<p>According to Infoblox, the person or entity that owns scotaibank[.]com has a portfolio of nearly 3,000 lookalike domains, including <strong>gmai[.]com</strong>, which demonstrably has been configured with its own mail server for accepting incoming email messages.

According to <strong>Satnam Narang</strong> at <strong>Tenable</strong>, this year marks the second consecutive year that Microsoft patched over one thousand vulnerabilities, and the third time it has done so since its inception.</p>\n<p>The zero-day flaw patched today is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62221\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2025-62221</a>, a privilege escalation vulnerability affecting <strong>Windows 10</strong> and later editions. The weakness resides in a component called the &#8220;<strong>Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver</strong>&#8221; &#8212; a system driver that enables cloud applications to access file system functionalities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is particularly concerning, as the mini filter is integral to services like OneDrive, Google Drive, and iCloud, and remains a core Windows component, even if none of those apps were installed,&#8221; said <strong>Adam Barnett</strong>, lead software engineer at <strong>Rapid7</strong>.</p>\n<p>Only three of the flaws patched today earned Microsoft&#8217;s most-dire &#8220;critical&#8221; rating: Both <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2025-62554</a> and <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2025-62557</a> involve <strong>Microsoft Office</strong>, and both can exploited merely by viewing a booby-trapped email message in the Preview Pane.

Breen said this flaw would allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by tricking the large language model (LLM) into running commands that bypass the user&#8217;s &#8220;auto-approve&#8221; settings.</p>\n<p>CVE-2025-64671 is part of a broader, more systemic security crisis that security researcher <strong>Ari Marzuk</strong> has branded <a href=\"https://maccarita.com/posts/idesaster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IDEsaster</a> (IDE  stands for &#8220;integrated development environment&#8221;), which encompasses more than 30 separate vulnerabilities reported in nearly a dozen market-leading AI coding platforms, including <strong>Cursor</strong>, <strong>Windsurf</strong>, <strong>Gemini CLI</strong>, and <strong>Claude Code</strong>.</p>\n<p>The other publicly-disclosed vulnerability patched today is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-54100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2025-54100</a>, a remote code execution bug in <strong>Windows Powershell</strong> on Windows Server 2008 and later that allows an unauthenticated attacker to run code in the security context of the user.</p>\n<p>For anyone seeking a more granular breakdown of the security updates Microsoft pushed today, check out the roundup at the <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%20December%202025/32550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SANS Internet Storm Center</a>.

Pokatilo and Perkon (Awesome Technologies) fizzled out shortly after its creation, and that Nerdify soon adopted the process of accepting assignment requests via text message and routing them to freelance writers.</p>\n<p>A closer look at an early &#8220;About Us&#8221; page for Nerdify in The Wayback Machine suggests that Mr. Perkon was the real co-founder of the company: The photo at the top of the page shows four people wearing Nerdify T-shirts seated around a table on a rooftop deck in San Francisco, and the man facing the camera is Perkon.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72799\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72799\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-72799\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/perkon-nerdify.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/perkon-nerdify.png 1628w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/perkon-nerdify-768x407.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/perkon-nerdify-1536x813.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/perkon-nerdify-782x414.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/perkon-nerdify-267x140.png 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72799\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Filip Perkon, top right, is pictured wearing a Nerdify T-shirt in an archived copy of the company&#8217;s About Us page.

Then Synergy kindly provided sponsorship for my Russian Film Week event that I created and ran until 2022 in the U.K., an event that became the biggest independent Russian film festival outside of Russia. Since the start of the Ukraine war in 2022 I closed the festival down.&#8221; </p>\n<p>&#8220;I have had no business with Vadim Lobov since 2021 (the last film festival) and I don’t keep track of his endeavours,&#8221; Perkon continued. &#8220;As for Alexey Pokatilo, we are university friends. Our business relationship has ended after the concierge service Awesome Technologies didn’t work out, many years ago.&#8221;</p>\n",

Experts say these same phishing groups also are now using SMS lures that promise unclaimed tax refunds and mobile rewards points.</p>\n<p>Over the past week, thousands of domain names were registered for scam websites that purport to offer <strong>T-Mobile</strong> customers the opportunity to claim a large number of rewards points. The phishing domains are being promoted by scam messages sent via Apple&#8217;s iMessage service or the functionally equivalent RCS messaging service built into Google phones.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72772\" style=\"width: 419px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72772\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72772\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tmobpoints-smish.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"409\" height=\"804\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72772\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An instant message spoofing T-Mobile says the recipient is eligible to claim thousands of rewards points.</p></div>\n<p>The website scanning service <strong>urlscan.io</strong> <a href=\"http://urlscan.io/result/019a609e-8dda-7612-a4b1-a6fe2c0bff6d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shows</a> thousands of these phishing domains have been deployed in just the past few days alone.

Merrill said multiple China-based cybercriminal groups that sell phishing-as-a-service platforms have been using the mobile points lure for some time, but the scam has only recently been pointed at consumers in the United States.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These points redemption schemes have not been very popular in the U.S., but have been in other geographies like EU and Asia for a while now,&#8221; Merrill said.</p>\n<p>A review of other domains flagged by urlscan.io as tied to this Chinese SMS phishing syndicate shows they are also spoofing U.S. state tax authorities, telling recipients they have an unclaimed tax refund. Again, the goal is to phish the user&#8217;s payment card information and one-time code.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72776\" style=\"width: 405px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72776\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72776\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dctaxphish.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"395\" height=\"842\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72776\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A text message that spoofs the District of Columbia&#8217;s Office of Tax and Revenue.</p></div>\n<h2>CAVEAT EMPTOR</h2>\n<p>Many SMS phishing or &#8220;smishing&#8221; domains are quickly flagged by browser makers as malicious. But Merrill said one burgeoning area of growth for these phishing kits &#8212; fake e-commerce shops &#8212; can be far harder to spot because they do not call attention to themselves by spamming the entire world.</p>\n<p>Merrill said the same Chinese phishing kits used to blast out package redelivery message scams are equipped with modules that make it simple to quickly deploy a fleet of fake but convincing e-commerce storefronts. Those phony stores are typically advertised on <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong>, and consumers usually end up at them by searching online for deals on specific products.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72789\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72789\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-72789\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fake-ecom.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fake-ecom.png 1146w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fake-ecom-768x276.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fake-ecom-782x281.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72789\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A machine-translated screenshot of an ad from a China-based phishing group promoting their fake e-commerce shop templates.</p></div>\n<p>With these fake e-commerce stores, the customer is supplying their payment card and personal information as part of the normal check-out process, which is then punctuated by a request for a one-time code sent by your financial institution. The fake shopping site claims the code is required by the user&#8217;s bank to verify the transaction, but it is sent to the user because the scammers immediately attempt to enroll the supplied card data in a mobile wallet.</p>\n<p>According to Merrill, it is only during the check-out process that these fake shops will fetch the malicious code that gives them away as fraudulent, which tends to make it difficult to locate these stores simply by mass-scanning the web. Also, most customers who pay for products through these sites don&#8217;t realize they&#8217;ve been snookered until weeks later when the purchased item fails to arrive.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The fake e-commerce sites are tough because a lot of them can fly under the radar,&#8221; Merrill said. &#8220;They can go months without being shut down, they&#8217;re hard to discover, and they generally don&#8217;t get flagged by safe browsing tools.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Happily, reporting these SMS phishing lures and websites is one of the fastest ways to get them properly identified and shut down. <strong>Raymond Dijkxhoorn</strong> is the CEO and a founding member of <a href=\"https://www.surbl.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SURBL</a>, a widely-used blocklist that flags domains and IP addresses known to be used in unsolicited messages, phishing and malware distribution. SURBL has created a website called <a href=\"https://smishreport.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">smishreport.com</a> that asks users to forward a screenshot of any smishing message(s) received.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If [a domain is] unlisted, we can find and add the new pattern and kill the rest&#8221; of the matching domains, <strong>Dijkxhoorn </strong>said. &#8220;Just make a screenshot and upload. The tool does the rest.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72786\" style=\"width: 367px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72786\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72786\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/smishreport.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"357\" height=\"772\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72786\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The SMS phishing reporting site smishreport.com.</p></div>\n<p>Merrill said the last few weeks of the calendar year typically see a big uptick in smishing &#8212; particularly package redelivery schemes that spoof the <strong>U.S. Postal Service</strong> or commercial shipping companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Every holiday season there is an explosion in smishing activity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everyone is in a bigger hurry, frantically shopping online, paying less attention than they should, and they&#8217;re just in a better mindset to get phished.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>SHOP ONLINE LIKE A SECURITY PRO</h2>\n<p>As we can see, adopting a shopping strategy of simply buying from the online merchant with the lowest advertised prices can be a bit like playing Russian Roulette with your wallet. Even people who shop mainly at big-name online stores <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/04/how-cybercrooks-put-the-beatdown-on-my-beats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">can get scammed</a> if they’re not wary of too-good-to-be-true offers (think third-party sellers on these platforms).</p>\n<p>If you don’t know much about the online merchant that has the item you wish to buy, take a few minutes to investigate its reputation. If you’re buying from an online store that is brand new, the risk that you will get scammed increases significantly. How do you know the lifespan of a site selling that must-have gadget at the lowest price? One easy way to get a quick idea is to run <a title=\"http://whois.domaintools.com/krebsonsecurity.com\" href=\"http://whois.domaintools.com/krebsonsecurity.com\">a basic WHOIS search</a> on the site’s domain name. The more recent the site’s “created” date, the more likely it is a phantom store.</p>\n<p>If you receive a message warning about a problem with an order or shipment, visit the e-commerce or shipping site directly, and avoid clicking on links or attachments — particularly missives that warn of some dire consequences unless you act quickly. Phishers and malware purveyors typically seize upon some kind of emergency to create a false alarm that often causes recipients to temporarily let their guard down.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not just outright scammers who can trip up your holiday shopping: Often times, items that are advertised at steeper discounts than other online stores make up for it by charging way more than normal for shipping and handling.</p>\n<p>So be careful what you agree to: Check to make sure you know how long the item will take to be shipped, and that you understand the store’s return policies. Also, keep an eye out for hidden surcharges, and be wary of blithely clicking “ok” during the checkout process.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, keep a close eye on your monthly statements. If I were a fraudster, I’d most definitely wait until the holidays to cram through a bunch of unauthorized charges on stolen cards, so that the bogus purchases would get buried amid a flurry of other legitimate transactions. That’s why it’s key to closely review your credit card bill and to quickly dispute any charges you didn’t authorize.</p>\n",

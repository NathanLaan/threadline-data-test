I am just lazing here. I have a Vision Pro (version two) strapped to my face, and I am watching some of my favorite shows on YouTube in all their glory on the official YouTube app for Vision Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the past two years, I have been waiting for the official app to arrive. Can you believe it has been two years since Apple launched this &#8220;headphone for the eyes&#8221;? Watching YouTube videos via the browser was fine, but it was nothing like getting a 4K (or higher bitrate) stream. The app allows you to access standard videos, 180° videos, 360° videos, and YouTube Shorts. The M5 chip version allows you to watch YouTube videos in 8K.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This release has made me so happy. I use Vision Pro pretty much all the time, and it is my favorite way to watch video streams. During the relevant sports seasons, I watch baseball, Formula One racing, and NBA games on Vision Pro. The YouTube app makes it even more indispensable for me. Now I need Plex to launch an official app, and I will be sated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Back to recline-and-watch mode!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day, everyone.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More on Vision Pro</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://om.co/2019/01/13/so-what-can-apple-do-next/\">What&#8217;s the Future of TV?

Both are big foundational AI companies. Both have changed how we think about information, code, and work. Both have very similar valuation metrics. Heck, both even have the same investors. One is chasing growth, margins, and building a real business. The other is chasing astronomical destiny. One is a consumer company with 800 million daily users. The other is an enterprise-focused company selling to businesses. The key difference is that one is focused and the other is doing way too many things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The real story is that Anthropic, despite its woo-woo ideas about the future, AI ethics, and post-AI morality, is on its way to building up a real money machine. So what can we learn from Anthropic&#8217;s recently announced funding? The company raised a whopping $30 billion at a self-disclosed valuation of $380 billion. If you look at the chart, you can see the valuation multiples are surprisingly close. Scratch the surface, and spot the differences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here is what stood out to me and why it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Anthropic</th><th>OpenAI</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Valuation</strong></td><td>$380B (Series G, Feb 2026)</td><td>$500B (Oct 2025); seeking $730–830B</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Revenue (ARR)</strong></td><td>$14B</td><td>$20B+</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Revenue multiple</strong></td><td>27x</td><td>25–42x (depending on next round)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total raised</strong></td><td>~$67B</td><td>~$58B; seeking another $100B</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Revenue growth</strong></td><td>10x annually, three years running</td><td>3x YoY</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Revenue mix</strong></td><td>85% enterprise</td><td>~85% consumer</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Path to profit</strong></td><td>Cash flow positive by 2027</td><td>$115B cumulative losses through 2029</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Enterprise market share</strong></td><td>~40% of enterprise LLM spend</td><td>~27%, down from 50%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Primary focus</strong></td><td>Enterprise</td><td>Consumer, other</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Highlights from <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-30-billion-series-g-funding-380-billion-post-money-valuation\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-30-billion-series-g-funding-380-billion-post-money-valuation\">the Anthropic press release</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Eighty-five percent of Anthropic&#8217;s revenue comes from businesses. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Five hundred customers now spend over a million dollars a year, up from a dozen two years ago. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eight of the Fortune 10 use Claude. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Anthropic is doing well largely thanks to Claude Code. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>The company is on a $2.5 billion run rate, which has more than doubled since January 1, 2026. Enterprise use is now over half of Claude Code revenue. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Four percent of all public GitHub commits worldwide. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What&#8217;s more interesting is that Anthropic projects positive cash flow by 2027. OpenAI projects $14 billion in losses in 2026 alone, cumulative losses of $115 billion through 2029. Anthropic simply needs to keep doing what it&#8217;s already doing. <br><br>If anything Anthropic&#8217;s press release also makes it clear that the two companies couldn&#8217;t be more different. OpenAI in comparison has 800 million users. Impressive. But since only about 5 percent pay, it needs to monetize through advertising.  And since they are building their own infrastructure, OpenAI needs to raise even more money. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much as I would like to believe Anthropic&#8217;s press release, I am old school. Big numbers deserve to be questioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Anthropic&#8217;s revenue went from $9 billion to $14 billion ARR in roughly six weeks. What drove that? Is it new contracts coming online, or is &#8220;run rate&#8221; being measured from a peak month? Run rate is the equivalent of a fun house mirror, so I am not easily impressed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If 85 percent of revenue is enterprise, and enterprise contracts are typically annual, how much of the $14 billion is contracted versus extrapolated from recent API usage? There is a big difference between locked-in revenue and a great month on the API meter. Some clarity would go a long way.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Claude Code at $2.5 billion ARR, &#8220;more than doubled since January 1,&#8221; implies roughly $1.2 billion on January 1 hitting $2.5 billion by mid-February. Is this sustainable usage or a launch surge? Not clear.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Five hundred customers spending $1 million-plus annually. What is the breakdown? How much of the $14 billion comes from the top 10 accounts? Clarity is Anthropic&#8217;s friend here.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A developer can swap from Claude to GPT in an afternoon. Enterprise contracts are sticky, but the underlying technology isn&#8217;t proprietary the way Oracle&#8217;s database was. If OpenAI ships a better model next quarter, do those Fortune 10 customers care about Anthropic&#8217;s margins? What is the actual switching cost?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The presence of Chinese AI models such as DeepSeek limits American AI&#8217;s upside. If inference gets commoditized, the whole margin thesis gets harder to defend.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Anthropic doesn&#8217;t own its compute. It rents from AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. That is capital-light, which helps margins. But those three landlords are also rivals. The frenemy question is a real one and it is not going away.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I am pretty certain Anthropic will be asked these, or somewhat similar, questions when they go on the roadshow for the IPO. Anthropic&#8217;s decision to release these numbers in its fundraising press release is indicative of their seriousness about going public. Why does this matter beyond the numbers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whoever goes public first sets the standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic has already hired Wilson Sonsini to advise on an IPO. If it files first, it puts real numbers in an S-1. Revenue mix, margins, cost of compute, path to profitability. Public markets care about these things in ways that private rounds do not. Every analyst covering OpenAI&#8217;s eventual offering will use Anthropic as the yardstick. This will be a problem not just for OpenAI but for everyone else selling AI to businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I use both products. I pay them both the max amount of money as an individual and I find value in both of them. At present, if I was forced to pick one, I would go with Anthropic. But that is for now. I am not very loyal to one or the other. If OpenAI was doing better for me, guess which chatbot will stay open longer, and which API will get more use? But in the first quarter of 2026, Anthropic seems the best-positioned company in a race where the finish line keeps moving. Elon is having a hissy fit over their funding. That tells you who is the leader. OpenAI is burning cash like a Concorde burned fuel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Welcome to 2026, when AI&#8217;s big boys have to start wearing their big boy pants and show their true worth.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap wp-block-paragraph\">If you missed the brouhaha around a 5,000-word blog post about AI, let me bring you up to speed. But before I do, I want to remind you that sometimes a blog post is not just a blog post. It is really about the spectacle of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let me rewind. HyperWriteAI CEO Matt Shumer&#8217;s post on Twitter, &#8220;<a href=\"https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/2021256989876109403\">Something Big Is Happening</a>,&#8221; went viral this week. Last check, it had over 75 million views, though I can guarantee you very few people read the whole thing. I bet not as many read the summary. Still, no stopping the chattering classes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It showed up so often in my feed that I decided to read it. I started and stopped a dozen times. I don&#8217;t know why I persevered. Glutton for punishment? My efforts should tell you something about the quality of writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His thesis is that coding is the canary in the coal mine and other professions will follow. That&#8217;s the meta point, and I don&#8217;t disagree with it. We are going through a sea change in how we interact with information, so professions are going to change as a result. The industrialization and automation of software has been a topic of discussion since my GigaOm days. When someone claims the canary is already dead and the rest of us are next, I want to hear what they have to say. Even if it takes a dozen attempts to get through the &#8220;essay.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What really kept me going was his Covid comparison. Shumer compared this moment in AI to February 2020, when a virus was spreading somewhere overseas and nobody was paying attention. He thinks we&#8217;re in the &#8220;this seems overblown&#8221; phase of something much bigger than Covid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not the first time I&#8217;ve heard that comparison. Months ago, a very smart, highly rational friend of mine explained it to me differently. And better. He pointed out that as average humans, we had never lived the scientific process the way we did with the Covid crisis and the emergence of the vaccine. No wonder everyone from pot-smoking podcasters to scientists had differing opinions. The whole thing was playing out in front of us in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The trials, the debates, the reversals, the uncertainty, the competing claims, the people who were sure they knew what was coming and turned out to be wrong. We watched science happen. It was messy, public, unfinished. And everyone became an armchair epidemiologist overnight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We are doing the exact same thing with AI. <a href=\"https://om.co/2026/02/09/conveniencing-ourselves-to-irrelevance/\">We are living inside the experiment.</a> The results aren&#8217;t in. But that doesn&#8217;t stop anyone from declaring them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shumer&#8217;s piece was greeted with enthusiasm by <em>Fortune</em> magazine&#8217;s editor in chief. A day later, Jeremy Kahn at <em>Fortune </em><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/02/12/matt-shumers-viral-blog-about-ais-looming-impact-on-knowledge-workers-is-based-on-flawed-assumptions/\">called it fear-mongering</a> built on faulty assumptions. <a href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/about-that-matt-shumer-post-that\">Gary Marcus called it</a> &#8220;weaponized hype.&#8221; <em>Fortune</em>&#8216;s AI reporter Sharon Goldman, who Shumer had personally pitched before publishing, <a href=\"https://sharongoldman.substack.com/p/matt-shumer-reached-out-to-me-ahead\">wrote that she was glad she didn&#8217;t read a draft</a>. Ed Zitron also pointed out that Shumer has a checkered past. In 2024, he released an AI model called Reflection 70B that he trumpeted as &#8220;the world&#8217;s top open-source model,&#8221; but <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/reflection-70b-model-maker-breaks-silence-amid-fraud-accusations\">independent researchers couldn&#8217;t replicate the results</a>. Turns out the model appeared to be a wrapper around Anthropic&#8217;s Claude rather than anything new. Shumer apologized, said he &#8220;got ahead of himself.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Let&#8217;s zoom out and focus on the real big question</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This whole drama, from the viral post to the takedowns to the counter-takes, none of it is really about Shumer&#8217;s essay. What it&#8217;s about is simpler. And harder to admit. In the words of screenwriter William Goldman, &#8220;Nobody knows anything.&#8221; As I have <a href=\"https://om.co/2026/02/09/conveniencing-ourselves-to-irrelevance/\">written before</a>, we are living in a petri dish of the future. Some of us are hopeful. Some of us are terrified. Most of us are both, often in the same hour. And into that vacuum of uncertainty there is a torrent of speculation dressed up as prophecy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shumer writes his breathless warning. Marcus writes his skeptical rebuttal. Kahn points out the flawed assumptions. Goldman notes the difficulty of separating signal from hype. And every one of them is also selling something. A book. A newsletter. A reputation. An audience. <a href=\"https://om.co/2026/01/21/velocity-is-the-new-authority-heres-why/\">Since attention is the currency and velocity is the authority</a>, AI at present is the best momentum asset class.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every cycle produces its prophets and its skeptics. And every cycle, the reality turns out to be different from what either camp predicted. Not better, not worse. Different. Yeah, I am so glad to be out of the damn forecasting business. I embrace the uncertainty, the future, and let it all happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for Twitter, it probably has moved on to something else. I am sure. I haven&#8217;t looked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right wp-block-paragraph\"><em>February 12, 2026. San Francisco </em></p>\n",

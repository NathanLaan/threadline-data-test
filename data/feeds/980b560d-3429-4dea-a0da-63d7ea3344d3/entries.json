      "content": "Identity Management (IAM) is a critical foundation of modern business security, ensuring that the right people—and systems—have access to the right resources at the right time. As organizations adopt cloud services, remote work, and digital platforms, identity has become the new security perimeter. By implementing strong authentication, least-privilege access, and automated user lifecycle management, businesses can reduce breach risks, meet compliance requirements, and enable secure growth in a digital-first world.",

      "content": "The uTorrent Transport Protocol (μTP) is a UDP-based protocol designed to make peer-to-peer file sharing faster, fairer, and more network-friendly. By using delay-based congestion control instead of traditional loss-based methods, μTP intelligently utilizes spare bandwidth while yielding to latency-sensitive traffic such as web browsing and video calls. This article explores how μTP works, why it was introduced, and how it improves both user experience and overall network health in modern BitTorrent ecosystems.",

      "content": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols enable decentralized communication by allowing devices to share data and resources directly without relying on a central server. By distributing workloads across participating nodes, P2P systems achieve high scalability, fault tolerance, and cost efficiency. Technologies such as BitTorrent, IPFS, blockchain networks, and WebRTC demonstrate how P2P protocols power modern applications ranging from file distribution to real-time communication and decentralized storage. As businesses and developers seek resilient and scalable architectures, P2P protocols continue to play a critical role in shaping the future of the internet.",

      "content": "A Cloud Service Level Agreement (SLA) defines the reliability, availability, and support standards a business can expect from its cloud provider. It outlines uptime guarantees, performance benchmarks, support response times, and compensation for service failures. Understanding your provider’s SLA is critical to minimizing downtime risks, protecting revenue, and maintaining customer trust. By carefully evaluating SLA metrics and limitations, businesses can design resilient cloud architectures and make informed decisions that align technology reliability with business goals.",

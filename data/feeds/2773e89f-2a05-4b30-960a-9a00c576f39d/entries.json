He volunteered to travel to the Ohio Valley on a mission to deliver a letter from Robert Dinwiddie, governor of Virginia, to the commander of French troops in the Ohio territory.

This confluence is where downtown Pittsburgh now stands, but at the time it was wilderness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2025/02/parallel-lives-king-george-and-george-washington-featured-in-an-upcoming-exhibit/\">King George II</a> authorized Dinwiddie to use force, if necessary, to secure lands that Virginia was claiming as its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a major in the Virginia provincial militia, Washington wanted the assignment to deliver Dinwiddie’s demand that the French retreat. He believed the assignment would secure him a British army commission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Washington received his marching orders on Oct. 31, 1753. He traveled to <a href=\"https://fortleboeufhistory.com/campus/washington-park/\">Fort Le Boeuf</a> in northwestern Pennsylvania and returned a month later with a polite but firm “no” from the French.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dinwiddie promoted Washington from major to lieutenant colonel and ordered him to return to the Ohio River Valley in April 1754 with 160 men. Washington quickly learned that French forces of about 500 men had already constructed the formidable Fort Duquesne at the forks of the Ohio. It was at this point that he faced his first major test as a military leader. Instead of falling back to gather more substantial reinforcements, he pushed forward. This decision reflected an aggressive, perhaps naive, brand of leadership characterized by a desire for action over caution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Washington’s initial confidence was high. He <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/past-projects/quotes/article/the-right-wing-where-i-stood-was-exposed-to-and-received-all-the-enemys-fire-i-heard-the-bullets-whistle-and-believe-me-there-is-something-charming-in-the-sound\">famously wrote to his brother</a> that there was “something charming” in the sound of whistling bullets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-jumonville-affair-and-an-international-crisis\">The Jumonville affair and an international crisis</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most controversial moment of Washington’s early leadership occurred on May 28, 1754, about 40 miles south of Fort Duquesne. Guided by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/tanaghrisson-the-half-king.htm\">Seneca leader Tanacharison</a>—known as the “Half King”—and 12 Seneca warriors, Washington and his detachment of 40 militiamen ambushed a party of 35 French Canadian militiamen led by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/joseph-coulon-de-jumonville.htm\">Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville</a>. The Jumonville affair lasted only 15 minutes, but its repercussions were global.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten of the French, including Jumonville, were killed. Washington’s inability to control his Native American allies—the Seneca warriors executed Jumonville—exposed a critical gap in his early leadership. He lacked the ability to manage the volatile intercultural alliances necessary for frontier warfare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Washington also allowed one enemy soldier to escape to warn Fort Duquesne. This skirmish effectively <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/french-indian-war/washington-and-the-french-indian-war\">ignited the French and Indian War</a>, and Washington found himself at the center of a burgeoning international crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-defeat-at-fort-necessity\">Defeat at Fort Necessity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Washington then made the fateful decision to dig in and call for reinforcements instead of retreating in the face of inevitable French retaliation. Reinforcements arrived: 200 Virginia militiamen and 100 British regulars. They brought news from Dinwiddie: congratulations on Washington’s victory and his promotion to colonel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His inexperience showed in his design of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fone/index.htm\">Fort Necessity</a>. He positioned the small, circular palisade in a meadow depression, where surrounding wooded high ground allowed enemy marksmen to fire down with impunity. Worse still, Tanacharison, disillusioned with Washington’s leadership and the British failure to follow through with promised support, had already departed with his warriors weeks earlier. When the French and their Native American allies finally attacked on July 3, heavy rains flooded the shallow trenches, soaking gunpowder and leaving Washington’s men vulnerable inside their poorly designed fortification.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"858\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-2-91490268-george-washington-leadership.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91492778\" srcset=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_150/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-2-91490268-george-washington-leadership.jpg 150w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_300/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-2-91490268-george-washington-leadership.jpg 300w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-2-91490268-george-washington-leadership.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 160px), 600px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Illustration showing George Washington signing the articles of capitulation at Fort Necessity during the French and Indian Wars, on July 3, 1754. [Photo: Interim Archives/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The battle of Fort Necessity was a grueling, daylong engagement in the mud and rain. Approximately 700 French and Native American allies surrounded the combined force of 460 Virginian militiamen and British regulars. Despite being outnumbered and outmaneuvered, Washington maintained order among his demoralized troops. When French commander Louis Coulon de Villiers—Jumonville’s brother—offered a truce, Washington faced the most humbling moment of his young life: <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/french-indian-war/articles-of-capitulation-fort-necessity\">the necessity of surrender</a>. His decision to capitulate was a pragmatic act of leadership that prioritized the survival of his men over personal honor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The surrender also included a stinging lesson in the nuances of diplomacy. Because Washington could not read French, he signed a document that used the word “l&#8217;assassinat,” which translates to “assassination,” to describe Jumonville’s death. This inadvertent admission that he had ordered the assassination of a French diplomat became propaganda for the French, teaching Washington the vital importance of optics in international relations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lessons-that-forged-a-leader\">Lessons that forged a leader</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1754 campaign ended in a full retreat to Virginia, and Washington resigned his commission shortly thereafter. Yet, this period was essential in transforming Washington from a man seeking personal glory into one who understood the weight of responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He learned that leadership required more than courage—it demanded understanding of terrain, cultural awareness of allies and enemies, and political acumen. The strategic importance of the Ohio River Valley, a gateway to the continental interior and vast fur-trading networks, made these lessons all the more significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the hard lessons Washington learned at the threshold of Fort Duquesne in 1754 provided the foundational experience for his later role as <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/appointment-as-commander-in-chief\">commander in chief of the Continental Army</a>. The decisions he made in Pennsylvania and the Ohio wilderness, including the impulsive attack, the poor choice of defensive ground and the diplomatic oversight, were the very errors he would spend the rest of his military career correcting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though he did not capture Fort Duquesne in 1754, the young George Washington left the woods of Pennsylvania with a far more valuable prize: the tempered, resilient spirit of a leader who had learned from his mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/christopher-magra-2579098\">Christopher Magra</a> is a professor of American history at the <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-tennessee-688\">University of Tennessee</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is republished from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

Housing economist Brad Hunter told <a href=\"https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/\"><em>ResiClub</em></a>: “The impending change in leadership at the Fed could lead to easier monetary policy, which could lead to lower mortgage rates, but this is not clear.

In fact, recent data showed that 4 out of every 5 homeowners with a mortgage has a rate below 6%. The share has waned gradually, a trend that will continue in 2026.

But lingering inflation risk and the likelihood that we’ll avoid a recession will keep the Fed from cutting more than the markets have already priced in. That’s why rates may dip below 6% occasionally, but not for any meaningful period. The Fed will change leadership in 2026, but that is also unlikely to bring significantly lower mortgage rates, as long term rates–like mortgage rates–are set by bond markets.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Windermere Real Estate:</strong> The economics team at Windermere Real Estate forecasts the 30-year fixed mortgage rate will average 6.25% in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Moody’s:</strong> The forecast by Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi has the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaging 6.23% in 2026—and 6.22% in Q4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cotality:</strong> Economists at the real estate analytics giant are predicting an average 30-year fixed mortgage rate of 6.2% in 2026. Selma Hepp, Cotality chief economist, tells <em>ResiClub</em>: “The 2026 outlook points toward a return to more typical market conditions, with mortgage rates expected to settle near 6%, home prices increasing gradually by about 2% to 4%, and improvements in both affordability and availability of homes for sale. Even so, continuing hurdles like higher non-mortgage expenses, including surging insurance costs and rising property tax bills, limited affordability, and uneven regional trends will keep bifurcating the market and impact decisions of both buyers and sellers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yale School of Management:</strong> Finance professor <a href=\"https://som.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/cameron-lapoint?utm_source=www.resiclubanalytics.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=what-to-expect-from-mortgage-rates-in-2026-as-predicted-by-21-different-major-research-groups\">Cameron LaPoint</a> forecasts the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to average 6.2% in 2026—and 6.05% in Q4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wells Fargo:</strong> Analysts at the bank <a href=\"https://wellsfargo.bluematrix.com/docs/html/88d2eafa-3a64-4cca-b013-4093132d9c99.html?utm_source=www.resiclubanalytics.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=what-to-expect-from-mortgage-rates-in-2026-as-predicted-by-21-different-major-research-groups\">forecast</a> 30-year fixed mortgage rate averages of 6.18% in 2026 (and 6.2% in Q4).

Gay Cororaton, chief economist of Miami Realtors, tells <em>ResiClub</em>: “With the Fed carefully balancing to achieve its dual mandate, inflation is likely to adjust downward to 2% slowly while the unemployment rate will edge up lightly or remain stable as the Fed avoids a hard landing. The only way for inflation to adjust quickly is if unemployment rises sharply as well to effect a decline in real wages. Either the Fed [is] still caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, I expect mortgage rates to essentially just move sideways, so sales and prices will also post very modest single-digit increases. Affordability will slightly improve but I don’t see prices falling significantly despite the modest demand because sellers will also pull back to preserve their home equity gains. With home affordability still the biggest challenge for homebuyers, the upper price tier or the market will continue to be the most active segment.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fannie Mae:</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.fanniemae.com/media/56531/display?utm_source=www.resiclubanalytics.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=what-to-expect-from-mortgage-rates-in-2026-as-predicted-by-21-different-major-research-groups\">latest forecast</a> issued by Fannie Mae in December has the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaging 6% in 2026 and 5.9% in 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Morgan Stanley:</strong> Strategists at the investment bank forecast the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate will finish 2026 at 5.75%. In a report published on November 19, 2025, Morgan Stanley analysts write: “As we gaze into our proverbial crystal ball for the year ahead, we see affordability improving at the margins as mortgage rates dip below 6%. That should provide a modest boost to both existing and new home sales, though we think there is more upside in 2027 than 2026. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The modest rally in the primary rate we expect to 5.75% will likely bring some new borrowers into the money, but the impact would be marginal: Only about 6% of conventional borrowers would benefit from that 50bp decline. Beyond that, the next 100bp drop would only add another 8% of borrowers. Meaningful refinance incentives don’t emerge until rates fall below 4%, leaving the market in what we call a “refi wasteland” for much of 2026—though we&#8217;ll note that just because we&#8217;re in a refi wasteland doesn&#8217;t mean mortgages in-the-money won&#8217;t see valuation challenges driven by shorter lags and increasing originator efficiency.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://kevinerdmann.substack.com/?utm_source=www.resiclubanalytics.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=what-to-expect-from-mortgage-rates-in-2026-as-predicted-by-21-different-major-research-groups\">Erdmann Housing Tracker</a>:</strong> Housing analyst Kevin Erdmann tells <em>ResiClub</em> he expects the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to average 5.75% in 2026—and finish 2026 at 5.22%.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1026\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-2-91493030-mortgage-rates-2026.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91493061\" srcset=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_150/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-2-91493030-mortgage-rates-2026.jpg 150w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_300/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-2-91493030-mortgage-rates-2026.jpg 300w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-2-91493030-mortgage-rates-2026.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 160px), 600px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Topline finding?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the 21 mortgage rate forecasts tracked by <em>ResiClub</em>, the average prediction is 6.18% for calendar year 2026.

Some of that reflects “pulled-forward” sales that occurred in 2020, 2021, or early 2022 rather than in 2023, 2024, or 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But much of the slowdown stems from affordability and the lock-in effect created by the rate shock and sharply higher switching costs: Many homeowners who would like to sell and move are either unwilling to take on a much higher monthly payment or unable to qualify for one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All else being equal, if mortgage rates were to fall more than expected, there would be slightly more turnover and sales in the existing home market.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"803\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-3-91493030-mortgage-rates-2026.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91493062\" srcset=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_150/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-3-91493030-mortgage-rates-2026.jpg 150w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_300/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-3-91493030-mortgage-rates-2026.jpg 300w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-3-91493030-mortgage-rates-2026.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 160px), 600px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say they’re wrong and mortgage rates fall more than expected. What happens?</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>There’s a potential wildcard—an economic slowdown. If joblessness were to climb faster than anticipated or if the economy were to meaningfully deteriorate, that could put additional downward pressure on both Treasury yields and mortgage rates. In that scenario, mortgage rates could dip more than the baseline forecasts suggest.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The “<a href=\"https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/mortgage-spread-could-help-lower-mortgage-rates-in-2026\">mortgage spread</a>” represents the difference between the 10-year Treasury yield and the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate. This week, the spread stood at <a href=\"https://x.com/NewsLambert/status/2003581444640194852?s=20&amp;utm_source=www.resiclubanalytics.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=what-to-expect-from-mortgage-rates-in-2026-as-predicted-by-21-different-major-research-groups\">207</a> basis points. If the spread—which widened when mortgage rates spiked in 2022—continues to compress/normalize toward its long-term average since 1972 (176 basis points), it could help push mortgage rates lower even if Treasury yields hold steady.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Housing stakeholders should keep in mind that a mortgage rate forecast is not a firm’s projection for the highest—or lowest—rate in the coming year. Rather, it reflects the average rate for the calendar year. And, of course, in any given year the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate can move well above and well below that annual average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/mortgage-rate-volatility-by-year-since-1972-high-low-range\">recent <em>ResiClub</em> analysis</a> of Freddie Mac’s weekly mortgage-rate dataset finds that since 1972, the average annual range in the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 1.4 percentage points. If you move the goalpost to just this century—since 2001—the average annual range in the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 1.08 percentage points. In 2025, the range was 0.87 point.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"887\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-4-91493030-mortgage-rates-2026.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91493064\" srcset=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_150/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-4-91493030-mortgage-rates-2026.jpg 150w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_300/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-4-91493030-mortgage-rates-2026.jpg 300w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-4-91493030-mortgage-rates-2026.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 160px), 600px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One last thought: Mortgage rate forecasts should always be taken with a grain of salt—at least to some degree. Predicting long-term yields depends on accurately anticipating inflation, Federal Reserve policy, and the broader trajectory of the U.S. and global economies, all of which are notoriously hard to get right. Over just the past five years, forecasters have been caught off guard by a pandemic, a historic inflation spike, and one of the fastest rate-hiking cycles in modern history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson? Even the best models can’t account for every shock. Mortgage rate forecasts are useful guideposts—but not guarantees.</p>\n\n\n<hr>",

But efforts to combat this trend have resembled a game of whack-a-mole because the factors driving it are so intertwined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One issue is the unique set of challenges that define drug development. As with any consumer good, manufacturers price prescription drugs to cover costs and earn profits. Drug manufacturing, however, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.15445\">involves an expensive</a> and <a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/fda-approval-process.html\">time-consuming development process</a> with a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2022.02.002\">high risk of failure</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patent protection is another issue. <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs/frequently-asked-questions-patents-and-exclusivity\">Drug patents last 20 years</a>, but completing costly trials necessary for regulatory approval takes up much of that period, reducing the time when manufacturers have exclusive rights to sell the drug. After a patent expires, generic versions can be made and sold for significantly less, lowering the profits for the original manufacturer. Though some data <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/17407745241259112\">challenges this claim</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.phrma.org/policy-issues/cost-of-medicines\">pharmaceutical industry contends</a> that high prices while drugs are under patent help companies recover their investment, which then funds the discovery of new drugs. And they often <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2025/nov/how-drugmakers-use-patent-process-keep-prices-high\">find ways to extend their patents</a>, which keeps prices elevated for longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are the intermediaries. Once a drug is on the market, prices are typically set through negotiations with administrators called <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-are-pharmacy-benefit-managers-a-health-economist-explains-how-lack-of-competition-drives-up-drug-prices-for-everyone-236772\">pharmacy benefit managers</a>, who negotiate discounts and rebates on prescription drugs for health insurers and employers offering benefits to their workers. Pharmacy benefit managers are paid based on those discounts, so they do not have an incentive to lower total drug prices, though <a href=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payers/employers-pharmacists-cheer-congress-finally-passes-pbm-reform\">new transparency rules enacted February 3</a> aim to change payment practices. Drugmakers often <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.13393\">raise the list price</a> of drugs to <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other-health/what-to-know-about-pharmacy-benefit-managers-pbms-and-federal-efforts-at-regulation/\">make up for the markdowns</a> that pharmacy benefit managers negotiate—<a href=\"https://schaeffer.usc.edu/research/the-association-between-drug-rebates-and-list-prices/\">and possibly even more than that</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many countries, centralized government negotiators set the price for prescription drugs, resulting in lower drug prices. This has prompted American officials to consider <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/international-reference-pricing-for-prescription-drugs/\">using those prices as a reference</a> for setting drug prices here. In its blueprint, the Trump administration has called for a <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/quick-take/president-trump-proposes-codifying-mfn-drug-pricing-deals-but-key-details-are-missing/\">“most-favored nation” drug pricing policy</a>, under which some U.S. drug prices would match the lowest prices paid in other countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may work in the short term, but manufacturers say it could also <a href=\"https://www.pharmexec.com/view/phrma-hda-bio-most-favored-nation-policy\">curtail investment in innovative new drugs</a>. And some industry experts worry that it may push manufacturers to <a href=\"https://petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2025/05/22/the-global-risks-of-americas-most-favored-nation-drug-pricing-policy/\">raise international prices</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How effective will TrumpRX be at lowering prescription drug prices for Americans?\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RpB9USJgm4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Policy experts have questioned whether TrumpRx will bring down drug prices.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late 2025, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/16/nx-s1-5678915/trumprx-pharma-drug-price-deals-list-prices\">16 pharmaceutical companies</a> agreed to most-favored nation pricing for some drugs. Consumers can now buy them directly from manufacturers <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/trump-rx-white-house-launches-direct-to-consumer-drug-site.html\">through TrumpRx</a>, a portal that points consumers to drug manufacturers and provides coupons for purchasing more than 40 widely used brand-name drugs at a discount, which launched February 5. However, many drugs available through the platform <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2026/02/06/trumprx-discount-drug-website-undercut-by-cheaper-generics/\">can be purchased at lower prices as generics</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-increasing-price-transparency\">Increasing price transparency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fewer than 1 in 20 Americans know <a href=\"https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/most-americans-have-no-idea-about-prices-before-they-receive-health-care\">how much healthcare services will cost</a> before they receive them. One fix for this seems obvious: Make providers list their prices up front. That way, consumers could compare prices and choose the most cost-effective options for their care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spurred by <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/5426629-congress-health-care-reform/\">bipartisan support in Congress</a>, the government has <a href=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payers/heres-how-price-transparency-could-evolve-after-election\">embraced price transparency</a> for healthcare services over the past decade. In February 2025, the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-02-28/pdf/2025-03440.pdf\">announced stricter enforcement</a> for hospitals, which must now post actual prices, rather than estimates, for common medical procedures. Data is mixed on whether the approach is working as planned, however. Hospitals have reduced prices for people paying out of pocket, but <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-hospital-price-transparency-rule-is-working-but-patients-still-need-help-using-it/\">not for those paying with insurance</a>, according to a 2025 study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one thing, when regulations change, companies make strategic decisions to achieve their financial goals and meet the new rules—sometimes yielding unintended consequences. One study found, for example, that price transparency regulations in a series of clinics led to an <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w32580\">increase in physician charges to insurance companies</a> because some providers who had been charging less raised their prices to match more expensive competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, a 2024 federal government study found that <a href=\"https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/2024/not-all-selected-hospitals-complied-with-the-hospital-price-transparency-rule/\">46% of hospitals were not compliant</a>. The American Hospital Association, a trade group, suggested price transparency <a href=\"https://www.aha.org/fact-sheets/2023-02-24-fact-sheet-hospital-price-transparency\">imposes a high administrative burden</a> on hospitals while providing confusing information to patients, whose costs may vary depending on unique aspects of their conditions. And the fine for noncompliance, $300 per day, may be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.2531\">insufficient to offset the cost of disclosing this information</a>, according to some health policy experts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond high costs, patients also worry that insurers <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2024/aug/unforeseen-health-care-bills-coverage-denials-by-insurers\">won’t actually cover the care</a> they receive. Cigna is currently fighting a lawsuit accusing its doctors of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/cigna-pxdx-medical-health-insurance-rejection-claims\">denying claims almost instantly—within an average of 1.2 seconds</a>—but concerns about claims denial are rampant across the industry. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-artificial-intelligence-controls-your-health-insurance-coverage-253602\">Companies’ use of artificial intelligence to deny claims</a> is compounding the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-1-91491293-cbo-federal-deficits-debt.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91491347\" srcset=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_150/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-1-91491293-cbo-federal-deficits-debt.jpg 150w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_300/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-1-91491293-cbo-federal-deficits-debt.jpg 300w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-1-91491293-cbo-federal-deficits-debt.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 160px), 600px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Fewer than 1 in 20 Americans know how much healthcare services will cost before they get them.

But curbing that increase significantly may be impossible without reining in overall healthcare costs and, paradoxically, keeping more people insured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance works by pooling money paid by members of an insurance plan. That money covers all members’ healthcare costs, with some using more than they contribute and others less. <a href=\"https://www.healthinsurance.org/glossary/health-insurance-premium/\">Premium prices therefore depend on</a> how many people are in the plan, as well as the services insurance will cover and the services people actually use. Because healthcare costs are rising overall, commercial insurance companies <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/10/trumps-plan-to-strong-arm-insurers-into-lower-prices-is-met-with-skepticism-00718333\">may not be able to significantly lower premiums</a> without reducing their ability to cover costs and absorb risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/health-policy-101-employer-sponsored-health-insurance/?entry=table-of-contents-introduction\">Nearly two-thirds of Americans under age 65</a> receive health insurance through employers. Another <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2026/01/22/what-the-data-says-about-affordable-care-act-health-insurance-exchanges/\">6.9% of them get it through Affordable Care Act marketplaces</a>, where enrollment numbers are extremely sensitive to premium costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enrollment in ACA plans <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/answers/how-many-people-are-in-affordable-care-act-plans-in-the-us/country/united-states/\">nearly doubled in 2021</a>, from about 12 million to more than 24 million, when the government introduced subsidies to reduce premiums during the COVID-19 pandemic. But when <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/health-insurance-subsidy-standoff-pits-affordable-care-for-millions-against-federal-budget-constraints-266851\">the subsidies expired</a> on January 1, 2026, about <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/map-health-insurance-enrollment-dropped-affordable-care-act-subsidies-2026-1\">1.4 million dropped coverage</a>, and for most who didn’t, <a href=\"https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2026/01/07/health-policy-roundup\">premiums more than doubled</a>. The Congressional Budget Office projects that <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-12/59230-ARPA.pdf\">another 3.7 million will become uninsured</a> in 2027, <a href=\"https://www.ajmc.com/view/5-consequences-if-aca-premium-subsidies-end-in-2026\">reversing some of the huge gains</a> made since the ACA was passed in 2010.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When health insurance costs rise, <a href=\"https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2026/navigating-an-unaffordable-health-insurance-market\">healthier people may risk going without</a>. Those who remain insured tend to need more health services, requiring those more costly services to be covered by a smaller pool of people and raising premium prices even higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump administration has proposed routing the money spent on subsidies directly to eligible Americans to help them purchase health insurance. How much people would receive is unclear, but <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-promises-health-care-cash-183000173.html\">amounts in previous proposals</a> wouldn’t cover what the subsidies provided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To sum it up, healthcare is extremely complicated and there are numerous barriers to reforms, as successive U.S. administrations have learned over the years. Whether the Trump administration finds some success will depend on how well the policies are able to surmount these and other obstacles.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/patrick-aguilar-2287392\">Patrick Aguilar</a> is the managing director of health at <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/washington-university-in-st-louis-732\">Washington University in St. Louis</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article is republished from </em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</a><em> under a Creative Commons license.

      "content": "\n<p>Personality is one of the most underrated predictors of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Personnel-Selection-Tomas-Chamorro-Premuzic/dp/0521868297\">career success</a> in the world. Defined by scientists as the range of habits and typical behaviors that make us who we are—and different from others—and with more than a century of robust academic evidence on how it impacts work and other real-life outcomes, here are some fascinating facts to digest:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(1) The simplest and most reliable way to understand someone’s personality is to look at their scores (position) along <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Personality-Individual-Differences-Tomas-Chamorro-Premuzic/dp/140519927X\">five universal traits</a>, namely emotional stability (how calm, composed, and non-anxious you are), extraversion (how sociable, assertive, and energetic you are), agreeableness (how kind, polite, and friendly you are), openness to experience (how curious, intellectual, and open-minded you are), and conscientiousness (how driven, organized, and self-controlled you are). In fact, every other character trait you may read about—e.g., EQ, grit, empathy, resilience, authoritarian, and overconfident—is nothing but a combination of those “Big Five” traits, if not merely one of them relabeled (old wine in new bottles).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(2)&nbsp;There are multiple ways to assess these personality traits, ranging from <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-22162-003\">peer-ratings</a> (most people would agree on their views of a specific person, since we all have consistent reputations and others are able to decode them), <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c=\"1\" title=\"AI\">AI</a>-scraping of digital footprints (what we say and do online, and how we say and do it compared to others), and science-based personality assessment (you can take a free, visual two-minute version <a href=\"https://app.mytrudy.com/onboarding\">here</a>). Although some believe that self-report questionnaires are inadequate to capture someone’s personality—because anyone can lie or distort their answers and manage impressions—well-designed tests translate someone’s preferred self-presentation into a prediction of their future performance, including how they behave in work and career settings.</p>\n\n\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-block=\"mv-promo-block\">{\"blockType\":\"mv-promo-block\",\"data\":{\"imageDesktopUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/images.fastcompany.com\\/image\\/upload\\/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit\\/wp-cms-2\\/2025\\/10\\/tcp-photo-syndey-16X9.jpg\",\"imageMobileUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/images.fastcompany.com\\/image\\/upload\\/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit\\/wp-cms-2\\/2025\\/10\\/tcp-photo-syndey-1x1-2.jpg\",\"eyebrow\":\"\",\"headline\":\"Get more insights from Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic\",\"dek\":\"Dr. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic is a professor of organizational psychology at UCL and Columbia University, and the co-founder of DeeperSignals.

Most notably, the “<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-6570.1998.tb00743.x\">Big Five</a>” have been found to predict job satisfaction (higher in emotionally stable, agreeable, and conscientious people), <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12184579/\">leadership potential</a> (higher in extraverted, emotionally stable, open-to-experience, and conscientious people), sales performance (higher in extraverts), general career progression (higher in conscientious and extraverted people, though the latter depends on culture), and resilience (higher in emotionally stable and conscientious people). Even negative or undesirable outcomes, such as absenteeism, work conflict, and career instability (all more likely when you have lower emotional stability, conscientiousness, and agreeableness). In short, who you are determines how you work and how you relate to work, including your boss, colleagues, and clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, the predictive power of personality is not destiny. Acknowledging that personality shapes career outcomes does not mean we are prisoners of our dispositions. It does mean, however, that control comes in specific and sometimes counterintuitive forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-behavioral-changes\">Behavioral changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, while it is hard to change your personality, it is entirely possible to change your behavior: Personality describes tendencies, not fixed scripts. It reflects what comes naturally, not what is possible. A useful way to think about personality is as a set of default settings rather than an immutable operating system. You may be naturally introverted, emotionally reactive, or low in conscientiousness, but that does not prevent you from acting differently when the situation requires it. It does mean that doing so will take more effort and intention than it would for someone whose personality aligns more closely with the role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where self-awareness becomes essential. Without it, people mistake their habits for necessities and their preferences for constraints. With it, they can anticipate when their instincts will help and when they will mislead them. Self-awareness is not achieved through introspection alone. It comes from structured feedback, personality assessment, coaching, and noticing patterns over time. If you receive the same feedback across roles, bosses, or teams, that is not coincidence. It is personality expressing itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A useful analogy is handedness. Being left-handed does not prevent you from using your right hand, but it does mean that writing with it will feel awkward and effortful at first. Over time, however, people adapt, compensate, and sometimes become functionally ambidextrous. Personality works in much the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-good-and-bad-matches\">Good and bad matches</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, there is no such thing as a universally good or bad personality. There are only good or bad matches. Traits become assets or liabilities depending on context. High extraversion is advantageous in leadership and sales, but less so in roles requiring sustained focus. High agreeableness supports collaboration, but can undermine negotiation and tough decision-making. High openness fuels learning and innovation, but may complicate execution if not balanced with discipline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why talent is often best understood as personality in the right place. Careers accelerate when environments reward who you already are rather than punish it. Much of what organizations label as “underperformance” is simply misfit. The same individual can look average in one role and exceptional in another, without changing much at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also explains why changing environments is often more effective than trying to change oneself. If development proves hard or slow, adjusting role design, team composition, or organizational culture can quickly turn a personality liability into a strength. This is not avoidance. It is strategic self-management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-change-happens\">Change happens</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, people can and do change, including in durable ways: Personality is relatively stable, but it is not fixed. Longitudinal research shows that people change across adulthood, often becoming more emotionally stable, agreeable, and conscientious over time. More targeted change can occur through sustained role demands, life events, and deliberate interventions such as coaching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crucially, coaching almost always works by helping people <a href=\"https://www.amazon.it/Dont-Be-Yourself-Authenticity-Overrated-ebook/dp/B0DRWCR97H\">go against their nature</a>. Leaders are rarely coached to do more of what comes naturally. They are coached to slow down when they rush, listen when they dominate, tolerate uncertainty when they avoid it, or impose structure when they prefer improvisation. In that sense, development is inherently anti-authentic. Growth usually requires behaving less like your default self, not more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also why development feels effortful. Personality change does not happen through insight alone, but through repeated behavioral experiments that gradually recalibrate habits. Over time, what once felt unnatural can become routine, expanding a person’s behavioral range.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-perfect-fit-isn-t-required\">A perfect fit isn’t required</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth, and critically, it is perfectly possible to succeed in roles that are not tailor-made for your personality: Personality explains a meaningful but limited portion of career success. Even under the most generous estimates, it accounts for perhaps 40% to 50% of the variance in outcomes, often less. The rest is explained by skills, learning, motivation, context, opportunity, and persistence. In practice, this means that people routinely succeed in roles that do not fit them naturally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Introverts can be excellent salespeople. They may not draw energy from constant interaction, but they often compensate through preparation, deep listening, and follow-up. Highly agreeable individuals can become effective negotiators by learning when to create constructive conflict. Risk-averse people can lead innovation by relying on disciplined experimentation rather than bold improvisation. Less conscientious individuals can thrive in structured roles by building external systems that compensate for their preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many of these cases, success depends on emotional labor: the ability to display enthusiasm, confidence, or composure that may not reflect one’s internal state but is appropriate for the role. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Labor-Invisible-Shaping-Lives/dp/1250777356\">Emotional labor</a> is often dismissed as inauthentic, yet it is one of the most underrated career skills. Many high performers succeed not because their jobs perfectly match who they are, but because they have learned to perform the role effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A useful analogy is acting. Good actors are not limited to playing versions of themselves. They succeed by understanding the demands of the role and adapting accordingly. Careers work much the same way. People often grow into roles that initially felt uncomfortable, not because their personality changed overnight, but because their capacity to adapt expanded.The danger is not stretching beyond your personality, but doing so indefinitely without recovery, awareness, or choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, personality shapes how we work, how others experience us, and how our careers unfold over time. It is one of the most powerful forces in career development precisely because it operates quietly and consistently. But influence is not destiny. With self-awareness, strategic choices, and deliberate development, people can work with their personality rather than be constrained by it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real risk is not having a particular personality. It is failing to understand the one you have, and mistaking “being yourself” for the same thing as being effective.</p>\n\n\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-block=\"mv-promo-block\">{\"blockType\":\"mv-promo-block\",\"data\":{\"imageDesktopUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/images.fastcompany.com\\/image\\/upload\\/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit\\/wp-cms-2\\/2025\\/10\\/tcp-photo-syndey-16X9.jpg\",\"imageMobileUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/images.fastcompany.com\\/image\\/upload\\/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit\\/wp-cms-2\\/2025\\/10\\/tcp-photo-syndey-1x1-2.jpg\",\"eyebrow\":\"\",\"headline\":\"Get more insights from Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic\",\"dek\":\"Dr. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic is a professor of organizational psychology at UCL and Columbia University, and the co-founder of DeeperSignals.

Kelce has not yet delivered a public answer to this question, and there’s widespread speculation. But his choice of <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/how-to-stop-using-filler-words-when-you-speak-and-stop-worrying-about-them-forever/91261513\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">words</a> when speaking about this decision may tell us which way he’s leaning. It’s a lesson for every communicator. Your choice of words carries meaning, whether you realize it or not. Sometimes that word choice can reveal more than you intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/travis-kelce-taught-a-lesson-about-recovering-from-failure-in-under-4-minutes/91241474\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chiefs just finished a dispiriting season</a>, the first in Kelce’s pro career in which the team did not make the playoffs. Kelce’s current contract with the team ends in March. As many have pointed out, he’s a shoo-in for the Hall of Fame, having broken so many records it’s hard to count them all. He truly has nothing left to prove.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, he’s <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/heres-the-real-reason-taylor-swift-started-dating-travis-kelce-its-a-lesson-for-every-leader/91227399\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">engaged to Taylor Swift</a>, with a rumored wedding date of <a href=\"https://robshuter.substack.com/p/exclusive-taylor-swift-and-travis-557https://robshuter.substack.com/p/exclusive-taylor-swift-and-travis-557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">June 13</a>. His looks, charisma, and his <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91394136/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-net-worth-after-engagement-how-it-compares-to-other-power-couples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">incredibly famous fiancée</a> mean there are many opportunities for him in the world of entertainment and sportscasting, beyond the <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/nfl-stars-jason-travis-kelce-just-taught-a-100-million-lesson-in-power-of-being-yourself.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wildly successful <em>New Heights</em></a> podcast he cohosts with his older brother, former Philadelphia Eagle <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/jason-kelce-just-turned-this-overused-4-word-phrase-into-something-meaningful/91181015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jason Kelce</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are several good reasons for the younger Kelce to retire this year. On the other hand, many people suspected he would retire a year ago, after the Chiefs failed in their quest for three in a row Super Bowl wins in a <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/travis-kelce-and-his-team-suffered-a-humiliating-defeat-his-response-is-a-lesson-in-leadership/91148105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">humiliating loss to the Eagles</a>. Despite those rumors, he returned to play another season.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-kelce-will-never-lose-his-love-of-the-game\">Kelce will never lose his love of the game</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In January, Kelce shared some of his thoughts on retirement during an episode of <em>New Heights</em>. “I’ve talked to a few people in the facility already, you know, having the exit meetings and everything, and they know where I stand, at least right now,” he said. “And I think there’s a lot of love for the game that’s still there, and I don’t think I’ll ever lose that. And, I don’t know, it’s a tough thing to navigate.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then he described the conditions under which he’d continue to play. “If I think my body can heal up and rest up, and I can feel confident that I can go out there and give it another 18-, 20-, 21-week run, I think I would do it in a heartbeat.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pay close attention to the word he used in that sentence. I <em>would</em> do it in a heartbeat, not I <em>will</em> do it in a heartbeat. The word <em>would</em> in this sentence indicates that at least some of the requirements he described have not been met. It may seem like a subtle distinction, but consider the two sentences, “I will go to the store” and “I would go to the store.” That second statement implies that there is some reason not to go and therefore the speaker will not go shopping.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-we-all-notice-word-choices\">We all notice word choices</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelce isn’t a grammar expert. In fact, his entire sentence is ungrammatical. I doubt he’s ever considered <em>will</em> versus <em>would</em>. But whether we think about them consciously or not, native English speakers are aware of distinctions like this one. Because of that, what he said is so revealing. Kelce’s retirement may not be a certainty. He says he hasn’t decided yet, and that may be true. But “I would do it in a heartbeat” suggests that, at least right now, he thinks he’ll go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, if you’re a speaker, entrepreneur, or business leader, pay close attention to your choice of words whenever you speak on any important topic. Otherwise, you could wind up telling careful listeners more than you intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/with-1-word-travis-kelce-may-have-unintentionally-revealed-his-retirement-plans/91289331\">originally appeared</a> on </em>Fast Company<em>’s sister website, Inc.com.</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inc.<em> is the voice of the American entrepreneur.

These days, however, many viewers aren&#8217;t just watching on their TV—they’ve got the game streaming right to their phones. <p>After more than two decades, NBC and the NBA have revived their partnership just in time to face this new challenge. In a media landscape where fans consume sports across traditional broadcasts, streaming platforms, and mobile devices, the question is no longer about how to televise the game, but how to design an experience that cultivates the league’s next generation of stars, its culture, and fandom while honoring the nostalgia that once defined the NBA on NBC.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video autoplay loop muted src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/faPpnDjx-afS6hazX.mp4\" playsinline></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: courtesy NBCUniversal]</figcaption></figure><p>“Our job is to document and cover the game and really celebrate the game,” says Pierre Moossa, coordinating producer for NBC Sports. “That was what we used to do back in the time when we had the NBA on NBC.”</p><p>Celebrating the game has become more complex as sports fans’ viewing habits are increasingly fragmented. “The consumption of sports is always evolving,” Moossa says. “Whether it&#8217;s social media, digital, social, streaming, we need to meet the viewer [where they are].” </p><p>To solve this, the NBA and NBC—in concert with Peacock, NBC’s streaming platform—are launching a new mobile-first feature called Courtside Live. It’s designed to function alongside traditional broadcast and gives Peacock viewers an unprecedented degree of production control by allowing them to swipe between multiple camera angles in real time, creating a more intimate experience of games.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-design-challenge-nbsp\">The Design Challenge </h2><p>In recent years <a href=\"https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-08-18-ibm-study-sports-fans-demand-more-dynamic-digital-content,-powered-by-ai\">mobile has become increasingly important to the fan experience</a>. “I always held my phone horizontally,” Moossa says. “People now hold their phone vertically to watch videos.”</p><p>This behavioral change started influencing Peacock’s overall strategy back in 2024, when it launched its Can’t Miss Highlights feature, which brought vertical video to the Peacock app for the first time. </p><p>“Vertical video laid the foundation and helped inform us as we were coming up with Courtside Live,” says Jim Denney, NBCU’s chief product officer, describing a process of experimentation in the lead-up to launching the product.</p><p>According to Denney, after NBC confirmed its new partnership agreement with the NBA, a cross-functional team got to work brainstorming ideas for a next-gen fan viewing experience. “ It&#8217;s really sitting down and starting from the fan and working backwards,” he says. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><video playsinline=\"\" muted=\"\" loop=\"\" autoplay=\"\"><source src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/g-2-91492814-nba-courtside.webm\"></source><source src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/g-2-91492814-nba-courtside.mp4\"></source></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: courtesy NBCUniversal]</figcaption></figure><p>“One of the ideas that came up was what if we could actually create the experience of being courtside—what would that feel like?” says John Jelley, SVP of product and user experience for Peacock and global streaming at NBCUniversal. “When you go to a game, you are looking around, you are seeing the coaches, here&#8217;s the athletes coming on, here&#8217;s the teams lined up. What if we could actually create the experience a fan [has] live but as part of the Peacock product experience?” </p><p>The product team presented the idea of a feature that allowed fans to flip through different camera views during a live matchup, both on their phone and TV. Denney says viewers who use multiple devices to watch NBA content tend to be more engaged, noting, “We wanted a cross-section of things that we would do [well] both on TV and on mobile devices.”</p><p>A major learning that came from the 2024 Paris Olympics broadcast is that there are two types of fans: casual and avid. In addition to providing a quality main broadcast, NBC and Peacock want to appeal to both audience segments by offering new ways to experience the action. They also found that fans who choose to watch events in multiple views simultaneously prefer to stay in that view. Courtside Live builds on that insight by re-creating the multi-view experience for mobile devices.</p><p>“If you think about your mobile experience, you are swiping up and down through vertical videos, and moving between different apps,” Jelley says. “What we see in that behavior is that fans want the option to [say] ‘Oh, I&#8217;m watching the game, there&#8217;s something great happening, I wonder if I could understand a bit more about that player or maybe catch up on some moment that happened earlier or see how the celebrities in the stands are reacting.’” He says making the right videos easily accessible to viewers created a net-new experience.</p><p>“We thought there was a real opportunity to do something completely new with Courtside, which was to bring that to everyone&#8217;s phones and everyone&#8217;s TVs through multi-view in a way that really hadn&#8217;t ever been done before,” Jelley explains. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-1-91492814-nba-courtside.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91493211\" srcset=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_150/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-1-91492814-nba-courtside.jpg 150w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_300/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-1-91492814-nba-courtside.jpg 300w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-1-91492814-nba-courtside.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 160px), 600px\" /></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-designing-courtside-live\">Designing Courtside Live</h2><p>The team began testing Courtside Live during NBA Summer League games at Golden State in July 2025 and quickly realized a big hurdle to clear involved translating horizontally captured video into a vertical format that could live on mobile phones. </p><p>“One of the things you have to do with Courtside Live and any vertical video is often you are shooting a scene with a TV camera, which is a 16-by-9 horizontal feed,” Denney says. “One of the concepts that we had was following [an individual] player [on the court], my understanding is the production team actually had a camera taped off [at] two edges so that the cameraman could actually keep somebody in view.”</p><p>In that instance, the production team initially used a robo-camera that wasn’t fit to capture the necessary angles. They revisited discussions with the vendor and explored options with more padding to identify the most suitable camera.</p><p>“Through that partnership with production, we found ways to make sure the users see exactly the right element,” Jelley says. “We employed some Japanese technology that allows the operators to make sure they&#8217;re delivering these live feeds [and] they can make sure they&#8217;re focused on the elements that are most interesting. . . . We&#8217;re using a variety of technologies to make sure that the user is getting the best possible experience in that vertical format.”</p><p>Another UX pain point was navigation. When Peacock users watch live sporting events on their mobile phones, they’re initially presented with the main traditional broadcast in landscape view. Below that main broadcast view, Jelley explains, users will now find a medley of game views. </p><p>The team designed the interface with one-handed use in mind, making standard interactions, like swiping through camera angles on mobile devices, intuitive. </p><p>“If you think about your phone and how you hold your phone, you have to be able to very easily navigate around this experience using just your thumb,” Jelley says. “We really thought about how we could make it easy to switch between these different angles very intuitively, and then use the picture-in-picture functionality that we know users love using on their phone.”</p><p>Jelley recognizes the paradox Peacock is balancing: While users want more choice, they don’t want to feel overwhelmed. His team’s testing focused predominantly on usability. To simplify navigation, the team used <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c=\"1\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> to design iconography that clearly communicates to viewers the different camera angles available. And to help viewers transition seamlessly between the main broadcast and alternative views without losing their place, the product team tweaked the styling of the main icon to guide viewers back to their original point of view. </p><p>“The big design constraint really was doing that on a small screen [because] you don&#8217;t have a lot of real estate,” Jelley admits. “You don&#8217;t want things to get in the way of the video, but you want to make it very easy to navigate. And I think the design we came up with really lands that well.” </p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-scalability-and-repurposing-nbsp\">Scalability and Repurposing </h2><p>Courtside Live is launching in earnest during the 75th NBA All-Star Game hosted at the Intuit Dome in Los Angeles. In preparation, the teams spent five days rehearsing for the three-day slate of All-Star events, including the Celebrity Game, Rising Stars, All-Star Saturday’s three-point and dunk contests, and Sunday’s new U.S.-vs.-World format.</p><p>According to Paul Benedict, the NBA’s SVP of broadcasting and content management, the action will be captured by 50-plus cameras, more than 20 super-slow-motion cameras, and a flying cable camera. To achieve crisp, cinematic storytelling, Benedict says the production centers on providing unique access typically reserved for All-Star week.</p><p>“What makes Courtside Live so special is those cameras are literally on the scores table, giving you that experience,” Moossa says. “I may never be able to sit courtside, but I can grab my phone and be able to see what that camera angle looks like.”</p><p>While these angles will be available via Peacock on mobile devices, Moossa notes that the traditional broadcast will also benefit from the Courtside Live feature. “So the ISO camera and the courtside cameras are going [to be] intertwined into the normal, traditional broadcast,” he says. </p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-learning-through-experimentation-nbsp\">Learning through Experimentation </h2><p>The NBC and Peacock teams are enthusiastic about what they’ll learn from their collaboration on this feature and its debut this weekend. </p><p>“We&#8217;ll be tracking each one of these [angles] and seeing how much people watch, how long in one view, how often do they come back,” Jelley says. “A lot of the goal of the experiences we built in mobile is about frequency, because we know that with your phone, you have it all the time. Seeing how frequently [users] come back to [the] experience is a great sign of how compelling it is and how much it becomes a part of people&#8217;s habits of watching.” </p><p>In addition to tracking each camera angle, Jelley and his team plan to track the percentage of mobile users who engage with Courtside Live, aiming to achieve a similar level of success as they did with the Can’t Miss Highlights feature.</p><p>NBC and Peacock already have an early signal of the feature’s potential because the technology is being employed for its current Winter Olympics coverage. While initially designed for the NBA, their Olympics partner applied it to hockey and figure skating, giving fans unique access to moments like the “kiss and cry” area, where skaters wait with their coaches for scores. This suggests the feature can scale beyond basketball to other live event experiences.</p><p>“You can imagine how this could apply to other events, whether that&#8217;s some of our entertainment events like the Macy&#8217;s Thanksgiving Day parade [or] anywhere where we have lots of different angles or even some of our other other shows,” Jelley says. “This will be a conversation. If this works well, how can we extend it?”</p><hr></p>\n",

And since I have been a full-time worker, I have also been party to a number of pie-in-the-sky conversations about the expat potential of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/retirement\">retiring</a> to Barcelona; Buenos Aires, Argentina; or Bangkok.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But conversations about leaving the United States have felt a little different over the last couple of years. It started when several of my parents’ contemporaries actually retired abroad, rather than just thinking about it. Then multiple friends picked up stakes—which included selling houses and cars and uprooting high-school aged kids—simply to relocate away from America.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just my circle of friends and acquaintances, either. <a href=\"https://csglobalpartners.com/news/us-expat-numbers-double-in-2025-as-americans-seek-new-lives-abroad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CS Global Partners </a>found a 102.4% jump in U.S. expatriation in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the last quarter of 2024—although that jump only represents an estimated 1,285 individuals in real numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As easy as it is to say you’d like to become an American expat living it up in another country, the reality isn’t necessarily that simple. I spoke to two people who have moved away from the U.S. about the hidden costs of emigration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-infrastructure-matters\"><a></a>Infrastructure matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Valerie Roseborough retired to Panama when she exited her career in sales and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c=\"7\" title=\"Marketing\">marketing</a>. She first got the expat itch during COVID-19. “In my early career, I had done a lot of solo international traveling,” she says. “Seeing so much of the world go through the same thing at one time reminded me of how connected I had once felt to the rest of the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That convinced Roseborough to start traveling more—with retirement in the back of her mind. She spent six months in Mexico and realized it was not her place. “The infrastructure wasn’t going to work for me,” Roseborough says. “It&#8217;s a large country and sort of challenging to move about from state to state and place to place.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Panama presented itself as an option, with its large international airport and <a href=\"https://www.flightsfrom.com/PTY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">direct flights to North America</a>, as well as generous discounts to retirees, Roseborough realized it was an ideal spot for her second act, as an expat. Travel to and from her home in the Washington, D.C. area makes it possible to stay closely connected with her children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But she also recognizes that her location in the States as she was planning the move also helped make the process easier. “I was fortunate in that I was relocating from Washington, D.C, which has a Panamanian consulate and embassy,” she says. “I just had to make an appointment and show up with the necessary documents.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t live in an area with a nearby embassy or consulate for the country you want to emigrate to, you may have to work through the State Department and handle everything via mail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-prepare-for-taxes\"><a></a>Prepare for taxes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rian Chandler-Dovis and her husband decided to immigrate to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, from Virginia several years ago. “We got down here, and we were like, we love this place,” she says. “What is it going to take to immigrate here?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mexico has a relatively flexible immigration policy, in part because “the government has instituted a <a href=\"https://www.avalara.com/us/en/vatlive/country-guides/north-america/mexico.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">16% sales tax</a> across the board,” Chandler-Dovis explains. This means immigrants to Mexico don’t necessarily have <a href=\"https://www.mexperience.com/financial-criteria-for-residency-in-mexico/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">onerous income requirements</a>, because even if you’re not paying income tax in Mexico, the 16% sales tax contributes massively to the economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you are living abroad and maintaining an American residency, that can complicate your income tax situation. Chandler-Dovis’s husband now earns income in Mexico, while she owns a business that is registered in the United States. They pay income tax in Mexico, but found that maintaining their residence in Virginia would change their tax status in ways that would complicate matters too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For tax purposes. Virginia is what you call a <a href=\"https://rookcpas.com/us-state-taxes/how-to-break-state-residency-abroad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sticky state</a>,” Chandler-Dovis says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are four other so-called sticky states: California, New Mexico, New York, and South Carolina. Each of these states consider individuals to still be tax residents even after moving abroad, and expects them to keep filing state tax returns and paying state taxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These states have also been known to levy penalties for noncompliance to any émigré foolish enough to think that moving to another country would cut any necessary tax ties to their former home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-not-all-costs-are-financial\"><a></a>Not all costs are financial</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, giving up their Virginia residency has a serious cost for Chandler-Dovis and her husband. Without an address in America, they can’t vote in U.S. elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In order to stay registered to vote, you have to have a U.S. address,” Chandler-Dovis says. “And the law says that if you move out of the country, your voter registration must reflect your last U.S. address.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be a serious catch-22 for Americans living abroad, especially those who are considering a move for political reasons. You may be stuck deciding between a nightmare of a tax scenario if you live in a sticky state or the ability to vote in American elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-opportunities-new-problems\"><a></a>New opportunities, new problems</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Living abroad can be a dream, an adventure, or an escape. But it will never be exactly what you expect, and it will always have hidden costs that you can’t possibly anticipate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, it’s important to take the infrastructure of both your destination and your current situation into account. Taking a trial run in your potential home, as Valerie Roseborough did in Mexico, can help a prospective expat determine if it will work. Her six months in Mexico made it clear that the Mexican infrastructure wasn’t a good fit and led her to Panama, which is perfect for her retirement. She also recognized that living in Washington, D.C. made applying for her visa much easier because of her proximity to the Panamanian consulate and embassy. If you aren’t as fortunate, expect the process to take longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxes will continue to be a headache no matter where in the world you live. While income may be less important to some countries, that does not necessarily mean you won’t need to worry about how your tax situation will affect your finances, immigration status, and residency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, taxes may affect an expat&#8217;s ability to maintain residency—and the ability to vote—in America. Make sure you consider all those kinds of nonfinancial costs before you make any decisions about moving.</p>\n",

Back in 2021, active housing inventory for sale, unsold completed new builds, and available lot supply all plunged to historic lows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But ever since the pandemic housing boom fizzled out in mid-2022, housing slack has been building back up in the housing market—especially in certain pockets of the Sun Belt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look no further than <a href=\"https://zondahome.com/new-home-lot-supply-index-2/?utm_source=www.resiclubanalytics.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=austin-and-denver-boast-significantly-oversupplied-lot-inventory-baltimore-and-philly-homebuilders-still-struggle-to-find-lots\">Zonda’s New Home Lot Supply Index</a>, which measures lot supply based on the number of single-family vacant developed lots and the rate at which those lots are absorbed via housing starts. A higher index value indicates a greater supply of single-family vacant developed lots, while a lower index value indicates a tighter lot supply/new construction market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That index reading for Q4 2025 climbed to 81.6—well above the all-time low of 35.8 set at the height of the pandemic housing boom in Q2 2022, when builders were buying as much entitled land as they could find.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"923\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/zondanewhomelotsupply.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91493117\" srcset=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_150/wp-cms-2/2026/02/zondanewhomelotsupply.jpg 150w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_300/wp-cms-2/2026/02/zondanewhomelotsupply.jpg 300w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/zondanewhomelotsupply.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 160px), 600px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zondahome.com/new-home-lot-supply-index-2/?utm_source=www.resiclubanalytics.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=austin-and-denver-boast-significantly-oversupplied-lot-inventory-baltimore-and-philly-homebuilders-still-struggle-to-find-lots\">According to Zonda</a>, homebuilder lot supply loosened/rose in 28 of the 30 major metro-area housing markets tracked over the past 12 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Housing markets like Austin, Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, L.A., Seattle, and Jacksonville, Florida, experienced some of the most significant year-over-year loosening of lot supply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, despite an uptick in available lots in some markets on a year-over-year basis, around half of major housing markets are still what Zonda considers “significantly undersupplied.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Zonda now considers Austin and Denver metro-area housing markets as “significantly oversupplied.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zonda’s New Home Lot Supply Index has five groupings:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>“Significantly oversupplied” = 125 score or higher</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Sightly oversupplied” = 115-124 score</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Appropriately supplied” = 85-114 score</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Slightly undersupplied” = 75-84 score</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Significantly undersupplied” = 74 score or lower</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1531\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/zondalotsupply2025q4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91493120\" srcset=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_150/wp-cms-2/2026/02/zondalotsupply2025q4.jpg 150w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_300/wp-cms-2/2026/02/zondalotsupply2025q4.jpg 300w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/zondalotsupply2025q4.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 160px), 600px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One year ago, just three major metro-area housing markets were “appropriately supplied” in terms of lot/land supply—Austin, Atlanta, and Dallas—and none were classified as “slightly oversupplied” or “significantly oversupplied.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast-forward to the latest reading, and 10 of the 30 markets now fall into the “appropriately supplied” category or higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1293\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/zondalotsupply2024q4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91493122\" srcset=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_150/wp-cms-2/2026/02/zondalotsupply2024q4.jpg 150w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_300/wp-cms-2/2026/02/zondalotsupply2024q4.jpg 300w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/zondalotsupply2024q4.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 160px), 600px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If Zonda had published data for more than 30 markets, my assumption—based on my own analysis—is that many pockets of Southwest Florida (including Cape Coral and Punta Gorda) would have ranked near the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Policy uncertainty, the current cost of living, student loans, labor market concerns, interest rates, home prices, changes to immigration, geopolitics, and more have all slowed consumer demand,&#8221;

But since its meaning has changed over the decades, I believe it needs to be redefined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, the idea of a zombie internet originated in the late 1990s or early 2000s. <a href=\"https://www.scworld.com/news/shocking-new-zombie-internet-threat?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">In this 2005 article</a> from the cybersecurity group SC Media, for example, author Marcia Savage refers to zombies as “compromised systems used by intruders to send spam, phishing emails, or launch denial-of-service attacks.” In other words, the original definition involved networked computers hijacked by malicious actors to spread malware or launch cyberattacks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the following decades, as the “<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91092650/dead-internet-theory-true-tiktok-ai-influencers\" target=\"_blank\">dead internet theory</a>” took off (positing that our current internet is composed primarily of content generated by bots) and artificial intelligence tools helped individuals <em>or</em> bots proliferate AI slop, the term <em>zombie internet</em> began to be repurposed. Take <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/email/24eb6cea-6fa6-4b98-a2d2-8c4ba33d6c04/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this May 2024 article from 404 Media</a>, in which Jason Koebler defines it as a place (Facebook, in this case) “where a mix of bots, humans, and accounts that were once humans but aren’t anymore mix together to form a disastrous website where there is little social connection at all.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we get to 2026, when <a href=\"https://x.com/johncoogan/status/2018393645339320769?s=46\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a February X post</a> from <em>TBPN</em> video podcast host John Coogan describes the zombie internet for the post-Moltbook era. In his view, it’s a place “where AI agents are sort of dead, but alive enough to move around.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I find all three definitions reasonable, especially for their time, I think there&#8217;s a need for even greater precision. As I see it, the zombie internet is one of the three distinct types of internets currently competing for dominance in cyberspace. Which will ultimately reign supreme is still unknown, but only by defining—or even redefining—them decisively can we begin to discuss their implications for each other and for us in the years ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-human-internet-the-dead-internet-and-the-zombie-internet\">The human internet, the dead internet, and the zombie internet</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In my view, the three types of internet that exist today are the human internet, the dead internet, and the zombie internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I define the human internet as the one we’ve known all our lives, filled with websites like Fast Company, CNN, Rotten Tomatoes, Wikipedia, Amazon, etc., plus personal blogs, legacy social media platforms, and more. The common theme among these millions of disparate sites—the thing that makes them part of the human internet—is that their content is <em>both created by humans and intended for human consumption</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dead internet, which no longer appears to be <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91092650/dead-internet-theory-true-tiktok-ai-influencers\" target=\"_blank\">just a theory</a>, is made up of algorithm-fueled sites like Grokipedia, AI chatbots like ChatGPT, SEO-manipulating content farms, and, increasingly, social media platforms like X, Facebook, and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/tiktok\" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c=\"10\" title=\"TikTok\">TikTok</a>. These sites are either entirely AI-generated (as with Grokipedia, ChatGPT, and modern content farms) or overrun with AI slop (as with today&#8217;s social media giants). In other words, the dead internet consists of spaces that host content that is <em>generated by artificial intelligence but is intended for human consumption.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we get to the zombie internet, which as yet is relatively small compared to the other two. In fact, the only firm example I can give is Moltbook, which is why the platform is so significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moltbook is commonly referred to as the &#8220;Reddit for AI agents,&#8221; a social network where AI agents (and only AI agents) can communicate with each other, discussing ideas, thoughts, and problems. AI agents can ostensibly use this shared communal space to learn new skills and workflows from other AI agents and to scrape knowledge from them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the zombie internet, on which there are no sentient creators or consumers. On the zombie internet, content—whether it’s articles, follows, or social media posts—<em>is both generated by AI agents and intended for AI agent consumption</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short: On the human internet, sentient beings are the creators and intended audience of the content. On the dead internet, non-sentient entities create the content, and sentient beings are the intended audience. And on the zombie internet, there is no sentience at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-consequences-of-a-human-free-internet\">The consequences of a human-free internet</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned before, Moltbook is the only concrete example of a zombie internet site we know of right now. But at the rate AI is progressing and proliferating, it’s conceivable that the zombie internet could become dominant as early as the 2030s. And that will have some pretty significant consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a zombie-internet-dominated world, advertising no longer makes financial sense for companies. Even if all sites on the zombie internet allow humans to peek in on what’s going on (as Moltbook currently allows), I suspect that most humans will grow tired of it in a relatively short time. After all, why would a person keep returning to an ostensibly communal space if they can’t contribute?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means any ads placed on these sites will be &#8220;seen&#8221; almost exclusively by the AI agents themselves, who don’t have bank accounts and have no use for physical or digital goods anyway. No amount of mental gymnastics would convince shareholders that advertising to these entities would yield a good return on investment. And if advertising leaves the internet, the &#8220;free&#8221; web dies with it, dramatically altering the cost-benefit analysis of cyberspace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let&#8217;s say that humans do stick around as a “read-only” audience on a dominant zombie internet. It seems like it wouldn&#8217;t take long for trust in what we see or read to collapse completely. Given that AI agents are well-known for hallucinating—confidently making things up when they don&#8217;t know the real answer—we could never be sure whether a zombie internet Wikipedia, for example, is stating true facts. Even the footnotes could be hallucinations. This distrust could accelerate the tech-driven social disintegration we&#8217;ve been experiencing for nearly two decades. Worse, if AI agents decide they want to manipulate a read-only human population, they could disseminate disinformation at a speed and with an ease we&#8217;ve never seen before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, short of malicious intent, could a zombie internet be good for humankind?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps there’s a silver lining. For those who loathe the social-media-influenced world we currently live in—where political divisiveness, loneliness, and mental health crises flourish—the zombie internet could present an opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loss of sentient genesis (when humans are no longer involved in creating what’s on the internet) may make people less likely to visit divisive, isolating platforms. I&#8217;ve already seen this in myself, in a way. With the proliferation of AI slop on social media platforms over the past several years, I find little incentive to visit the sites anymore. If it&#8217;s just slop, why should I care about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the rest of my biological brethren start to feel the same way about an internet filled with Moltbooks, perhaps we’ll all get off our screens more often, get less outraged, and actually go outside and talk to each other again like human beings once did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;ll happily leave the internet to the AI agents.</p>\n\n\n<hr>",

      "content": "\n<p>Stress isn’t just an occasional visitor in our lives—it’s more the houseguest who never got the hint to leave. Between economic uncertainty, workplace upheaval, rounds of layoffs, and the delightful unpredictability of daily life (surprise traffic jams, anyone?), most of us are living in a near-constant state of low-grade panic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here’s something most people don’t realize: resilience—the ability to stay calm, flexible, and creative in the face of stress—isn’t just an inborn trait. It’s a skill. One that can be learned, practiced, and strengthened. And some of the most effective tools for doing that come not only from the world of business or psychology, but also from improv comedy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stumbled on this connection over a decade ago. During the day, I worked with startups and leaders—after hours, I practiced and performed improv. Eventually, I noticed the overlap: The same tools that help improv comedians thrive on stage can help anyone navigate the unscripted, often absurd, realities of modern work and life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And research backs this up. <a href=\"https://intellectdiscover.com/content/journals/10.1386/dj_00028_1?originator=authorOffprint&amp;identity=33371911&amp;ts=20261027132019&amp;signature=0ba637993b7b165b4f62911cfd0e51c0#html_fulltext\">A study</a> I conducted in collaboration with neuroscientist Dr. Ori Amir found that improvisational activities improve creativity, confidence, and even sleep, some of the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/topics/resilience/building-your-resilience\">key elements</a> of resilience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are three specific improv-inspired practices I use myself and share with leaders, teams, and individuals navigating change, uncertainty, and desiring a new way to cope with life’s stressors. They’re deceptively simple but surprisingly effective, precisely because they work with the brain’s stress response, not against it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-yes-and-mindset-from-resistance-to-resourcefulness\">The &#8216;Yes, And&#8217; Mindset: From Resistance to Resourcefulness</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve all been there: The project scope changes at the last minute. The client scraps months of work. The market tanks overnight. The instinctive reaction? Resistance. Frustration. Freeze mode. That’s not just emotional, it’s neurological. When our brains perceive a threat (even a calendar invite titled “urgent”), the body shifts into fight, flight, or freeze mode, flooding us with cortisol and narrowing our focus to survival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In improv, the foundational rule is “Yes, and.” It means accepting what’s happening (even when it’s not what you wanted) and building from it. It’s not about blind agreement; it’s about acknowledging reality so you can move forward instead of staying stuck. From a nervous system perspective, “Yes, and” mimics <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301051115000630\">emotional acceptance</a> and acts as a regulatory tool: It signals safety to the brain by reducing resistance, which helps shift you out of survival mode and into a more flexible, solution-oriented state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider this real-world example: When the pandemic hit, many restaurant owners faced ruin. Some who thrived, like those who pivoted to pop-up markets or meal kits, were effectively practicing “Yes, and.” They acknowledged reality and improvised forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next time stress hits, try this: Literally say to yourself, “Yes, this is happening. And here’s one thing I can do.” Even identifying one small action helps break the paralysis of overwhelm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fire-your-inner-judge-quieting-the-critical-voice-that-blocks-action\">Fire Your Inner Judge: Quieting the Critical Voice That Blocks Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that keeps people stuck in stress is an overactive inner critic. In improv, there’s no time for the voice in your head that says “That’s a stupid idea” or “You’ll mess this up.” You have to act before you overthink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In every workshop I lead, including one for a Fortune 500 team navigating layoffs, the first thing I ask everyone to do is “fire the judge.” Everyone pictures their inner critic, then, together, on the count of three, we say whatever needs to be said to let go of judging the activities we’re about to do, judging each other, and judging ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effect? Most people report feeling both lighter and sharper, because they’ve bypassed the internal filter that often fuels stress and indecision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t just theatrical. It’s neurological. <a href=\"https://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Self-Criticism.pdf\">Research shows</a> that self-criticism is associated with higher anxiety, while reducing it through self-compassion improves emotional regulation and cognitive flexibility. Softening judgment creates the conditions for clearer thinking and more effective action.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-if-it-feels-weird-do-it-using-unusual-actions-to-ground-and-reframe\">If It Feels Weird, Do It: Using Unusual Actions to Ground and Reframe</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the fastest ways to disrupt a stress spiral is to do something that feels slightly ridiculous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In improv, weird is where the magic happens. The unexpected action, like walking backward while giving a speech, or delivering a toast in gibberish, pulls us out of autopilot and into the present. It breaks habitual thinking and creates space for a new response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we do something “weird,” it works in two ways: First, it grounds us. Movement or gesture <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5033979/\">helps regulate our emotions and the nervous system</a>. Second, it primes the brain for possibility. <a href=\"https://pscresearch.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/112/2014/09/Simonton-Diversifying-Experiences-Cognitive-Flexibility-2012.pdf\">Engaging in unexpected behavior</a> temporarily loosens our grip on “the way things are,” which makes space for “the way things could be.” It’s a reset button for the brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s one “weird” three-minute exercise to try. Start pointing at objects around you and naming them out loud. Point to a table and say “table,” a plant and say “plant.” Do this for 30 seconds. Now shift: point at objects and label them with anything they are not. Point to a chair and say “giraffe,” a laptop and say “birthday cake.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels silly, and that’s the point. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17576282/\">Research shows</a> that simply naming what we see or feel can calm the nervous system by shifting attention to the present moment. Combined with <a href=\"https://pscresearch.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/112/2014/09/Simonton-Diversifying-Experiences-Cognitive-Flexibility-2012.pdf\">deliberately disrupting automatic thinking</a> (even by saying the “wrong” word), we loosen cognitive rigidity and open the door to more creative problem-solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve led this exact exercise with executive teams navigating pressure, and every time, it opens the room. People laugh. Shoulders drop. Ideas start flowing. Weird works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tools aren’t about turning you into a comedian. They’re about building a more responsive, resilient nervous system, and one that can meet chaos with curiosity instead of collapse. Stress may be the houseguest who never leaves, but improv is how you learn to live with it, laugh with it, and maybe even dance with it. Try one of these practices the next time stress hits, and you might just surprise yourself.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Spotify&#8217;s most senior engineers don’t type code anymore. In fact, they have not written a single line of code since December, co-CEO Gustav Söderström revealed during a recent earnings call.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not that they’ve stopped working. Instead, through a combination of Claude Code and Honk (a specialized internal system at Spotify), the company’s engineers can now develop new features simply through Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As a concrete example, an engineer at Spotify on their morning commute from Slack on their cellphone can tell Claude to fix a bug or add a new feature to the iOS app,” Söderström told analysts on the company&#8217;s February 10 earnings call.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And once Claude finishes that work, the engineer then gets a new version of the app, pushed to them on Slack on their phone, so that he can then merge it to production, all before they even arrive at the office.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Söderström said the new <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c=\"1\" title=\"AI\">AI</a>-fueled developments—which he traced to the December release of Antropic’s Claude Opus 4.5 within Claude Code—are “just the beginning” in terms of how Spotify will deploy the tech to build new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has been on a big push for new user tools, adding more than 50 features in 2025, most of which launched over the past few weeks. Söderström credits the combination of Claude Code and Honk with “speeding us up tremendously,&#8221; noting that it&#8217;s changed how developers operate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Certainly [before AI tools] I spent my entire vacation coding rather than being on holiday, and I think most people in tech did,” Söderström said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He isn’t alone. In a <a href=\"https://x.com/bcherny/status/2015979257038831967?s=46&amp;t=zHQCBTtfz3hXdhbfUsgEAg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">post on X</a> in late January, Boris Cherny, head of Anthropic’s Claude Code, shared that he hadn&#8217;t written any code in more than two months, noting that “pretty much 100%” of the company’s code is AI-generated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Davos last month, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted that a year from now AI will be handling most or all software engineering work from start to finish. &#8220;I think we will be there in three to six months, where AI is writing 90% of the code. And then, in 12 months, we may be in a world where AI is writing essentially all of the code,&#8221; Amodei said at a Council of Foreign Relations event, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-ceo-ai-90-percent-code-3-to-6-months-2025-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Business Insider</em> reported</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That timeline is looking increasingly realistic given that Spotify is just one example. Pinterest is another. On the company’s February 12 <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2026/02/12/pinterest-pins-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">earnings call</a>, CEO Bill Ready revealed that roughly half of Pinterest’s new code is now AI-generated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as AI does the lion&#8217;s share of coding, Söderström said developers are focused on learning quickly and refining their approach. &#8220;If this was the end of the change, you could say ‘This is what happened, now let us retool for this,’” Söderström explained. &#8220;The tricky thing is that we are in the middle of the change, so you also have to be very agile.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reacting to news of Söderström&#8217;s AI bullishness, some professional developers seized the opportunity to get their digs in. “It’s true,” Epic Games programmer Ryan Fleury <a href=\"https://x.com/rfleury/status/2022183699085955489\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wrote on X</a>. “In fact, I was under the impression that Spotify’s best developers hadn’t written a line of code since 2014.”</p>\n\n\n<hr>",

What was once a niche luxury item for women is now widely available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a <a href=\"https://silentspring.org/news/hair-extensions-contain-many-more-dangerous-chemicals-previously-thought\">new study from the scientific research organization</a> <a href=\"https://silentspring.org/news/hair-extensions-contain-many-more-dangerous-chemicals-previously-thought\">Silent Spring Institute</a> says many hair extensions—including products made from human hair—contain dozens of hazardous chemicals, with some linked to cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research, published in the American Chemical Society journal <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/envhealth.5c00549\"><em>Environment &amp; Health</em></a>, provides the strongest evidence to date about the potential health risks associated with these largely unregulated beauty products. The risks disproportionately affect Black consumers: The study found that over 70% of Black women reported wearing hair extensions at least once in the past year, compared with &#8220;less than 10% of women from other racial and ethnic groups.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The findings come at a time when many women&#8217;s beauty products are under scrutiny, with a growing number of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/08/nx-s1-5389925/beauty-products-chemicals-formaldehyde-cancer\">studies</a> finding cancer-causing chemicals in products ranging from shampoo and conditioner, to soap and lotion, to skin lightener, eyeliner, eyelash glue, and even <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/toxic-metals-and-cancer-risks-found-in-lipsticks-lip-glosses/\">lipstick</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many hair extensions are made from synthetic fibers and bio-based materials, which are often treated with toxic chemicals to ensure they are flame-resistant, waterproof, or antimicrobial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers analyzed chemicals in 43 popular hair extension products—including compounds that are not typically tested—and using machine-learning software, they were ultimately able to identify 169 of the more than 900 compounds. According to the study, all but two of the samples they tested contained hazardous chemicals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those chemicals included flame retardants, phthalates, pesticides, styrene, tetrachloroethane, and organotins—which are linked to cancer, hormone disruption, developmental problems, and immune system disruption. (In girls, the chemical compounds are also <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/hair-extensions-chemicals-breast-uterine-cancer\">linked</a> to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/how-early-is-too-early-for-children-to-reach-puberty\">early puberty</a> and uterine fibroids.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Companies rarely disclose the chemicals used . . . leaving consumers in the dark about the health risks from prolonged wear,” said Elissia Franklin, a research scientist at the Silent Spring Institute. &#8220;The fibers sit directly on the scalp and neck, and when heated and styled, they can release chemicals into the air that wearers may breathe in.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study concludes that more industry regulation is needed. &#8220;The findings make clear that stronger oversight is urgently needed to protect consumers and push companies to invest in making safer products,” Franklin said.</p>\n",

Total same-store sales fell 10.1% over the quarter, driven by low performance in the U.S., where same-store sales were down 11.3% (compared to 2% at international locations). Overall, global systemwide sales were $3.4 billion, a decrease of 8.3% from the previous quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Ken Cook, Wendy’s interim CEO, one way the company is addressing the downward trend is through ongoing “system optimization,” which includes the closure of “consistently underperforming restaurants” to allow franchisee partners to focus on more profitable locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shares in Wendy’s Co. (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WEN/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nasdaq: WEN</a>) jumped about 5% in early trading on February 13, but the company’s stock prices overall are nearing lows that haven’t been seen <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wendys-sales-keep-getting-worse-as-the-stock-sinks-toward-a-13-year-low-f1fb0976?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfvabBN9qV0AjzQ7ZIfpLNbgNBtO6xEx-z0ggQuuUUzlcXd8psYJrtAreD6h6M%3D&amp;gaa_ts=698f5d6a&amp;gaa_sig=sqHSoke5S34Ixzydmhix9G3atD-RhIahGd-g1Xcz3K6YiSs6T12BiUX49SMrCPhlx5DRFRQ2igKgR8Mq2c2sRg%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">since 2013</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wendy-s-closure-updates\">Wendy&#8217;s closure updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wendy’s first announced plans to shutter several hundred U.S. stores <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91437595/wendys-closing-hundreds-of-locations-list-of-fast-food-casualties-in-2025-grows-longer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in November 2025</a>. At the time, Cook told investors that some restaurants “do not elevate the brand” and are “a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective.” Cook shared that 28 restaurants closed during the fourth quarter of 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wendy’s operated about 6,000 U.S. stores before any of the closures. Its aim to cut down up to 6% of domestic operations amounts to shuttering roughly 300 to 360 storefronts this year. Cook said the closures were decided in partnership with franchisees, who worked to flag underperforming restaurants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We established a disciplined process with our franchisees to approach this restaurant by restaurant, working with them to make the best decisions that strengthen the system in the long term,” Cook said, adding, “Obviously it takes time to work with landlords and achieve what will be a win-win for both the franchisees and the Wendy&#8217;s company for those sites that we&#8217;re in, so that&#8217;ll take a little bit longer to see the rental income impact versus the closures.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wendy’s did not immediately respond to <em>Fast Company</em>’s request for more information on the specific numbers and locations of its planned closures.</p>\n\n\n<hr>",

Somewhere to take your AI valentine on a date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of Saint Valentine’s Day on February 14, EVA AI decided to solve that problem. The app—which allows users to text or, more recently, video chat with AI dates—organized a pop-up social experiment at Same Same Wine Bar in Manhattan this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On February 11 and 12, the dimly lit space was filled with patrons seated at tables for one, headphones on, their AI companions propped up on phone stands in front of them. Attendees could bring their own AI partners or engage in speed dating with EVA’s AI characters (there are 100 to choose from).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is another step in the company’s long-term strategy to push the boundaries of interaction with AI and make AI relationships a new normal,” EVA AI said in a press invite to the event, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-new-york-city-date-night-for-ai-lovers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Wired</em> reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform connects users with a virtual partner “who listens, supports all your desires and is always in touch with you,” its <a href=\"https://evaapp.ai/app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website reads</a>, promising you can “build relationships and intimacy privately on your terms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"434\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-1-eva-AI.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91492887\" srcset=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_150/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-1-eva-AI.jpg 150w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_300/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-1-eva-AI.jpg 300w, https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/02/i-1-eva-AI.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 160px), 600px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: EVA AI]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While this may sound like the future Spike Jonze’s sci-fi movie <em>Her</em> <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/1683548/joaquin-phoenix-falls-for-an-ai-scarlett-johannson-in-the-trailer-for-her\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">warned about</a> back in 2013, organizers say the goal is not to replace human relationships. Instead, they aim to normalize AI companionship for those already interested in or curious about trying it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surveys suggest younger adults are increasingly open to the idea. A <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/why-teens-use-ai-companions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nationally representative survey</a> of 1,060 teens ages 13 to 17 found that 72% have engaged with an AI companion at least once, and more than half qualified as regular users in 2025. Of those surveyed, 13% said they interact with AI companions daily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More broadly, people are turning to AI platforms for romantic connection. The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, a leading sex research center, found in its <a href=\"https://news.iu.edu/kinseyinstitute/live/news/45955-the-great-relationship-reset-singles-in-america-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Singles in America survey</a> published last year that 16% of participants were using AI as a romantic partner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That shift comes as singles grow increasingly disillusioned with dating other humans. Amid an era of “<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91290607/this-new-dating-app-is-bringing-a-pokemon-go-approach-to-romance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">swipe fatigue</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91149035/online-dating-app-burnout-artificial-intelligence-tinder-grindr-hinge-bumble\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dating app burnout</a>,” AI is playing a larger role in people’s dating lives. Just over a quarter of singles already use AI “wingmen” to enhance their dating prospects—up 333% from 2024, according to a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91352361/how-singles-are-using-ai-to-improve-their-online-dating-success\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent study</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone would feel comfortable sitting across from an AI companion in a crowded bar, especially surrounded by human couples. But the experiment underscores how quickly AI is seeping into everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re single this Valentine’s Day, there’s always Chad the AI chatbot waiting for the chance to sweep you off your feet.</p>\n\n\n<hr>",

As an Oscar-winning screenwriter himself for <em>Good Will Hunting</em> (not to mention being an acclaimed actor, director, and producer), Affleck knows a thing or two about the movie business, and he summed up AI-generated creative writing in one word: “shitty.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“By its nature, it goes to the mean, to the average,&#8221; he said on a January episode of <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em>. &#8220;And it’s not reliable. I mean, I can’t even stand to see what it writes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I actually don’t think it’s very likely that it’s going to be able to write anything meaningful or, in particular, that it’s going to be making movies from whole cloth,” Affleck noted. He predicted instead that, for filmmaking, AI is “gonna be a tool, just like visual effects.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As a guy who works in tech, is building with AI, and writes a weekly newsletter on the topic, I can&#39;t explain as well as Ben Affleck.<br><br>How is that possible? <a href=\"https://t.co/Gj6dNwaDgj\">pic.twitter.com/Gj6dNwaDgj</a></p>&mdash; Katyayani Shukla (@aibytekat) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aibytekat/status/2021920547995889917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 12, 2026</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But if Affleck is right, then why are artists of all kinds being fed the narrative that AI will be stealing their jobs? Fearmongering from the AI industry is to blame, he claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There’s a lot more fear, because we have this sense, this existential dread: ‘It’s gonna wipe everything out!’ Affleck explained on the podcast. &#8220;But that actually runs counter, in my view, to what history seems to show—which is that adoption is slow. It’s incremental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think a lot of that rhetoric comes from people who are trying to justify valuations around companies, where they go: ‘We’re gonna change everything! In two years, there’s gonna be no more work!’&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Well, the reason they’re saying that is because they need to ascribe a valuation for investment that can warrant the cap expend they’re gonna make on these data centers.” (Affleck&#8217;s comments come as <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91450218/ai-data-center-boom-unexpected-winner\">Big Tech&#8217;s spending on AI data centers</a> has swelled in the last year.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Affleck’s take went viral again this week, thanks to <a href=\"https://x.com/aibytekat/status/2021920547995889917\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a post on X</a> from a self-described &#8220;guy who works in tech&#8221; who is &#8220;building with AI and writes a weekly newsletter on the topic.&#8221; He joked that Affleck could explain AI’s applications better than industry experts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The actor concluded that, in filmmaking, large language models (LLMs) will likely &#8220;be good at filling in all the places that are expensive and burdensome,&#8221; but that &#8220;it’s always gonna rely fundamentally on the human artistic aspects of it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, some on social media are pointing out that, in a sense, Affleck’s point proves itself: The human touch of a creative writer led to clear, digestible communication. Funny how that works.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Starbucks competitor Dutch Bros saw its stock price rise in premarket trading on Friday after the coffee chain posted double-digit revenue growth in its most recent quarter. However, shares were flat as of late morning, with the stock (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BROS/\">NYSE: BROS</a>) hovering at just over $50 a share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps even more important for the stock—and for those investors who are long on it—is the chain’s announcement that it is on track to nearly double its store footprint by 2029. Here’s what you need to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dutch-bros-had-a-record-q4-2025\">Dutch Bros had a record Q4 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dutch Bros was founded in 1992, but it’s only been in recent years that the coffee chain started to become a household name, thanks to its ever-expanding footprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while the company isn’t yet as well known as Starbucks, it is increasingly looking like a significant threat to the Seattle coffee giant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday, Dutch Bros reported its <a href=\"https://investors.dutchbros.com/news/news-details/2026/Dutch-Bros-Inc--Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx\">fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results</a>, showing impressive gains in nearly every key metric, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Total revenue:</strong> $443.6 million (up 29.4% year over year)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Net income: </strong>$29.2 million (versus $6.4 million in the same quarter a year earlier)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Systemwide same shop sales: </strong>up 7.7%</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adjusted EBITDA:</strong> $72.6 million (up 48.8%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The company also issued strong guidance in many metrics for its current fiscal year 2026, including projected total revenue of between approximately $2 billion and $2.03 billion, and same-shop sales growth of 3% to 5%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But besides its financial numbers, Dutch Bros also revealed something else: Its aggressive store expansion plans are on track for 2029, and if it achieves its goals, the company’s footprint could nearly double over the next three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dutch-bros-plots-new-store-openings-for-2026-and-beyond\">Dutch Bros plots new store openings for 2026 and beyond</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While same-store sales are increasing for Dutch Bros, one of the fastest ways for any chain to boost overall sales is to open more locations. And that is exactly what Dutch Bros has been doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In its full-year fiscal 2025, which just ended, Dutch Bros said it opened 154 new stores across 22 states. That put its total number of locations at 1,136 stores in 25 states, as of December 31.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And its aggressive rollout is continuing in 2026. In a supplemental earnings slide deck the company <a href=\"https://s28.q4cdn.com/741412594/files/doc_presentations/2026/Feb/12/Q4-2025-Dutch-Bros-Investor-Presentation.pdf\">released</a>, it revealed that it expects “at least” 181 new Dutch Bros stores to open in 2026. Those new openings are in service of the company’s lofty 2029 goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By that year, the company says it aims to have 2,029 stores across the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bros-stock-rises-today-but-is-still-red-for-the-year\">BROS stock rises today, but is still red for the year</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After announcing its record-breaking fiscal 2025 results, Dutch Bros&#8217; stock jumped by nearly 4% in early morning trading. However, at the time of this writing, much of those gains have been given back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The early-morning stock price gain was no doubt welcome to investors.

      "content": "\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first generation was built on large models, demonstrating what could be done and powering many tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The second generation is focused on reducing costs and saving time. Replacing workers or making them more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But you can&#8217;t shrink your way to greatness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The third generation will be built on a simple premise, one that the internet has proven again and again:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Create value by connecting people.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We haven&#8217;t seen this yet, but once it gains traction, it&#8217;ll seem obvious and we&#8217;ll wonder how we missed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Create tools that work better when your peers and colleagues use them too. And tools that solve problems that people with resources are willing to pay for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Problems are everywhere, yet we often ignore them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And communities (existing and those that need to exist) are just waiting to have their problems solved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">[Here&#8217;s a list of network-based tech companies you may have heard of: Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, LinkedIn, Wikipedia, Discourse, Airbnb, Etsy, Stack Overflow, Pinterest, Twitch, eBay, Squidoo, Snapchat, GitHub&#8230; You can&#8217;t use them alone, and they work better when others use them too.]</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, most AI projects ignore the very network effects that built the internet. That&#8217;s almost certain to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For those with paraskevidekatriaphobia, consider this your opportunity to build something worth building instead of just waiting for the negative consequences of this change to arrive&#8230;</p>\n",

But in this moment (and the next) we&#8217;ll choose just one or two to rehearse and allow it to alter our decisions, outlook and interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So the key question is simple:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Is it helping?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It&#8217;s clear that the story is a choice. You can change it. Not all at once, not easily, but of course, we change our focus. This takes effort, and it&#8217;s worthwhile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And since we can change it, it&#8217;s a tool.

I wrote <a href=\"/2025/05/09/apple-turnover\">Apple Turnover</a> because so many of my notions kept running into a dead end: I could no longer bring myself to believe Apple would do these things without a change in leadership.</p>\n\n<p>When a company is described as being “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnaround_management\">in turnaround</a>,” that usually means it needs to be restored to financial health and solvency. Apple in the late 1990s was in turnaround. Apple today is one of the most successful companies in the history of the world, <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/tag/quarterly/\">regularly reporting huge profits</a>, so the term may seem inapplicable.</p>\n\n<p>There’s an old adage: <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill?cpPosIndex=1#:~:text=Never%20let%20a%20good%20crisis%20go%20to%20waste.\">never let a good crisis go to waste</a>. When things get bad, people are more open to changes they previously wouldn’t consider. But avoiding a crisis entirely is even better. This is where Apple finds itself today: in need of turnaround-scale changes, but not currently in the kind of (usually financial) crisis that will motivate its leaders to make them.</p>\n\n<p>New leadership is almost always part of a turnaround. In part, that’s because poor financial performance is one of the few remaining sins for which CEOs are reliably held to account. But it’s also because certain kinds of changes need the credibility that only new faces can bring.</p>\n\n<p>So what are those changes? What are the things I think Apple should do, but that its current leadership seems unwilling to budge on? What changes require a level of engagement and understanding that Apple no longer seems to have?</p>  \n\n<h2 id=\"new-deal\">A New Deal for Developers</h2>\n\n<p>Apple’s relationship with developers is an essential part of its long-term success. Apple cannot do everything on its own. It needs third-party developers to expand the capabilities of its products and platforms. Developers make Apple’s products more valuable.</p>\n\n<p>Apple needs the things third-party developers produce, but it also needs something else: their trust and enthusiasm. When the iPhone was introduced in 2007—without support for third-party apps—Apple’s developer community was <i>on fire</i> with <a href=\"/fatbits/2007/01/20/the-message\">the desire to create their own iPhone apps</a>. They wanted it so badly that they <a href=\"https://blog.iconfactory.com/2018/03/a-lot-can-happen-in-a-decade/\">hacked their way to success</a> even before Apple announced the iPhone SDK in 2008. This passion from developers helped rocket the platform to its current astronomical level of success. The iPhone was a rising tide that lifted all boats—at the start, anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Today, developers are <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/apple-in-2024-the-six-colors-report-card/#:~:text=cycle.%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94%20Stephen%20Hackett-,Developer%20relations,Grade%3A%20D,-(average%20score%3A%202.4\">unsatisfied</a> with their relationship with Apple. There are plenty of rational arguments for why they “shouldn’t” be, but as I argued in <a href=\"/2020/06/20/the-art-of-the-possible\">The Art of the Possible</a>, none of that changes the facts on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Could Apple’s current leadership change some policies to turn this around? Maybe, but it would be an uphill climb to win back what has been lost. For years, Apple has refused to do what it takes to heal this divide. Even when <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown\">ordered by the courts</a> to make changes in this area, Apple has worked hard to ensure that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/apple/659296/apple-failed-compliance-court-ruling-breakdown\">its “compliance” with these rulings</a> does as little as possible to make things better for developers. And all the while, Apple has done <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/661032/apple-epic-games-app-store-antitrust-ninth-circuit\">everything in its power</a> (and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/659301/apple-executive-lied-under-oath-epic-alex-roman\">some things beyond</a>) to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/663361/apple-halt-app-store-ruling-appeal\">fight</a>  the changes.</p>\n\n<p>So, yeah, it would be very hard for <i>that</i> Apple to convince developers that it has turned over a new leaf, even if it wanted to. (And, thus far, it very much does not want to.) New leadership would have a more convincing story and a stronger mandate for change.</p>\n\n<p>When thinking about what those changes might be, it’s tempting to believe it would be as simple as altering the revenue split between developers and Apple. But money is not actually the heart of the matter. Witness how developer sentiment <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/02/apple-in-2021-the-six-colors-report-card/#:~:text=and%20bundled%20apps.%E2%80%9D-,Developer%20relations,-Grade%3A%20C%2D\">did not appreciably improve</a> when Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/\">lowered its App Store commission from 30% to 15%</a> in 2020 for businesses earning less than $1 million per year.</p>\n\n<p>Developers like money, but what they <i>need</i> is respect. What they need is to feel like Apple listens to them and understands their experience. What they need is to be able to make their own decisions about their products and businesses.</p>\n\n<p>To understand just how little power the App Store commission rate alone has to heal this relationship, consider how Apple might leave the rate <i>unchanged</i> and still turn developer sentiment around. Maybe something like this…</p>\n\n<p>Start by changing App Review from a Kafkaesque nightmare to a sane, functioning, supportive process in which Apple and developers work together to successfully release software. That means timely, two-way communication with recognizably human entities at Apple. App reviewers should be able to convince developers that they have both read and understood their messages, and they should be empowered to help solve problems.</p>\n\n<p>Next, create a public bug tracker (with an option for developers to keep some information or entire bug reports private to ensure proprietary information is not exposed). Develop Apple’s own software “in the open” as much as possible. Publish average response times and fix times for bugs, and maintain those numbers at levels that satisfy developers.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, remove all restrictions on third-party payment methods and app stores. Provide an even playing field (to the extent possible) for third-party replacements for Apple’s own store and payment systems. Freedom of choice is the best way—perhaps the <i>only</i> way—to ensure that developers are satisfied with Apple’s App Store commission, in-app purchase system, and app review process. Developers who don’t like it can go elsewhere. If Apple wants them back, it will have to <i>compete</i> for their business.</p>\n\n<p>An Apple that does all of this well could maintain its current App Store commission while also satisfying its developers.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, the details don’t matter as much as choosing the correct way to measure success. Apple will know it has succeeded when third-party developers feel like Apple is their partner in success, rather than their adversary or overlord.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"premium-experience\">A Premium Experience for Premium Prices</h2>\n\n<p>One of the best ways to command high prices while maintaining customer satisfaction is to cultivate a reputation for standing behind your products. Apple today is actually pretty good at this. Its hardware is mostly sturdy and reliable, and its support experience is arguably among the best in the industry (even if that is an admittedly low bar).</p>\n\n<p>But there’s one area where Apple falls far short of its ideals: software reliability. Premium brands accrue tremendous customer loyalty when their products work as expected. When it comes to software, achieving this goal requires the relentless pursuit of bugs until the ones that remain are so uncommon that most people never see them.</p>\n\n<p>Though it might not be obvious to people who have never worked in the software industry, this is actually a leadership issue. Striking the correct balance between creating new features and ensuring that existing features work correctly (and gradually improve) <i>requires</i> leadership dedicated to this strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly everything in this industry will push leaders in the opposite direction. New features drive sales. When there’s a hot new technology, companies need to show that they’re able to use it, lest they get left behind. These are all good, important motivators—which is why it’s so incredibly hard for leaders to successfully defend the far less glamorous practices of fixing bugs and enhancing existing features.</p>\n\n<p>But defend they must. Adding features wins games, but bug fixing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_wins_championships\">wins championships</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6/#no-new-features\">15 years since Apple’s leadership last demonstrated</a> that it’s willing to emphasize software reliability <i>at the cost of</i> new features. Since then, bugs in major features have been allowed to fester, unfixed, for years on end.</p>\n\n<p>The recent <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino\">Apple Intelligence fiasco</a> has revealed that the company is further away from properly prioritizing software reliability than it has ever been. Apple was seemingly willing to sacrifice everything, including its own reputation, to ensure that it had enough new AI features to announce at WWDC. If we want a different result, we need different leaders.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"growth-the-hard-way\">Growth the Hard Way</h2>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/applefinancials-2025-5-2-1.png\">iPhone sales have plateaued</a>, Apple has turned to <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/applefinancials-2025-5-2-3.png\">services revenue</a> to maintain its growth. Unfortunately, selling more and more services to your existing customers is inherently corrosive to <a href=\"/2025/05/09/apple-turnover\">the core philosophy that has led to Apple’s tremendous success</a>. Here’s Steve Jobs <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/10/steve-jobs-solved-the-innovato#:~:text=Steve%20Jobs%20described%20one%20fundamental%20root%20cause%20of%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20problems.%20That%20was%20to%20let%20profitability%20outweigh%20passion\">describing where former Apple CEO John Sculley went wrong</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>“My passion has been to build an enduring company where people were motivated to make great products. The products, not the profits, were the motivation. Sculley flipped these priorities to where the goal was to make money. It’s a subtle difference, but it ends up meaning everything.” ―Steve Jobs</blockquote>\n\n<p>With every red badge in iOS Settings, every pop-up come-on to subscribe to Apple TV+, and every <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/27/23934961/google-antitrust-trial-defaults-search-deal-26-3-billion\">multi-billion-dollar product placement deal</a>, Apple chips away at the customer experience in exchange for income growth.</p>\n\n<p>The pursuit of financial success above all else inevitably leads to ruin. In the past, Tim Cook has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/03/at-apple-shareholders-meeting-tim-cook-tells-off-climate-change-deniers/\">demonstrated</a> that he does understand this. But thus far, his dedication to services revenue growth has been unshakable. He either doesn’t agree that this runs counter to Apple’s core values, or he’s willing to undermine those values in exchange for growth.</p>\n\n<p>New leadership at Apple will surely face similar pressure to continue growing. If pursuing services revenue is off the table, what options remain?</p>\n\n<p>It’s conventional wisdom that iPhone sales have leveled off now that Apple has “run out of people.” Nearly every human who can afford a smartphone already has one. But they don’t all have <i>iPhones</i>. <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide\">Android phones still dominate</a> in worldwide market share.</p>\n\n<p>If Apple wants growth, it should try winning some new customers the old-fashioned way: by making products that more people want to buy. In this case, that means making iPhones that current Android customers want to buy…<i>and can afford</i>.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, going down-market has been anathema to Apple. Apple’s pricing is an important market signal that communicates product quality and desirability. It’s unrealistic to assume that Apple can compete with the lowest of the low-end Android phones. But it’s equally absurd to believe that the current market share line between Android (~70%) and Apple (~30%) is unmovable. Millions of “iPhone-class” (and iPhone-priced) Android phones are sold every year. Apple can and should compete for that business.</p>\n\n<h2>Future Days</h2>\n\n<p>This list of suggestions is not exhaustive. An inventory of all the things Apple should do would include getting its house in order when it comes to AI, reducing its dependence on China, hitting its <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/environment/\">2030 environmental goals</a>, making <a href=\"/2013/03/08/the-case-for-a-true-mac-pro-successor\">a decent Mac Pro</a> again, and a million other things, most of which Apple <i>can</i> accomplish as it exists today.</p>\n\n<p>This article is specifically about the things it seems like Apple can’t or won’t do <i>without new leadership</i>. I’ve described three of the most important and impactful, but there’s more. That’s the promise and the danger of regime change. New people have a chance to rise above the sins of the past and make new choices. They can also make new mistakes, and they’ll have their own strengths and weaknesses. There is no such thing as a perfect leader.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if I had to pick one person to successfully transition Apple away from its current level of dependence on China, it would be Tim Cook. But that job will take many more years, and <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/05/tim-cook-says-he-probably-wont-be-at-apple-in-10-years-time/\">Cook has said</a> he probably won’t be at Apple much past the end of the decade.</p>\n\n<p>Finding a good successor for Tim Cook won’t be easy, no matter when it happens. But it does have to happen, and sooner is better than later.</p>\n\n<p>I hope I’m wrong about all this. I hope Apple’s current leaders take a hard look at some of these longstanding issues and are brave enough to change their minds. <a href=\"/2025/05/09/apple-turnover\">Faith lost</a> can be restored, with effort. Either way, as always, I’m pulling for Apple to succeed.</p>",

For over a decade, the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19961221164930/http://www.ambrosiasw.com/\">Ambrosia website</a> included this quotation on its homepage:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“<span id=\"virtue\">Virtue does not come from money, but rather from virtue comes money, and all other things good to man.</span>” <span class=\"attribution\">―Socrates</span></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, don’t try to make money. Try to make great things, and the money will surely follow. It’s a strategy that’s simple to explain, but almost impossible for any company to follow.</p>\n\n<p>Folks in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_title#Senior_management\">C-suite</a> will try to tell you that these two goals are perfectly aligned—that making great products is part of being a profitable company. But they mean it in the same way that Frosted Flakes is <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdjacentToThisCompleteBreakfast\">part of a complete breakfast</a>. It’s on the table, sure…along with a glass of milk, a poached egg, toast with jam, and a piece of fruit. It turns out that, as far as big corporations are concerned,  one part of this spread is actually kind of optional.</p>\n\n<p><i>From virtue comes money, and all other good things.</i> This idea rings in my head whenever I think about Apple. It’s the most succinct explanation of what pulled Apple from the brink of bankruptcy in the 1990s to its astronomical success today. <i>Don’t try to make money. Try to make a dent in the universe.</i> Do that, and the money will take care of itself.</p>\n\n<h2>Turn, Turn, Turn</h2>\n\n<p>Dissatisfaction with Apple among its most ardent fans has, at various times, reached a crescendo that has included public demands for a change in leadership. The precipitating events could be as serious as Apple <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html\">bowing to pressure from an authoritarian</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/3/24335290/apple-donation-donald-trump-inauguration-tim-cook\">regime</a>, or as trivial as releasing an unsatisfying new version of an <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/professional-video-editors-weigh-in-on-final-cut-pro-x/\">application</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/19/4748572/apple-jony-ive-ios-7-interview\">operating system</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Despite <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/2022/03/30/independence-day\">making my living</a> by <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/fatbits/2009/05/06/hypercritical\">criticizing</a> <a href=\"https://atp.fm\">Apple</a>, I tend not to get caught up in the controversy of the moment. When Apple <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+Q2lEOGReE/1:05:00\" data-atp-episode=\"222\">ruined its laptop</a> <a href=\"https://cottonbureau.com/p/WWMPQ8/shirt/butterfly-keyboard#/1537167/tee-men-premium-lightweight-white-100percent-cotton-s\">keyboards</a>, I wasn’t calling for Tim Cook’s head. I just wanted them to fix the keyboards. And they did (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design\">eventually</a>).</p>\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/2014/04/27/creativity-inc\">success hides problems</a>, and even the best company can lose its way. To everything, there is a season.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I’m concerned, the only truly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_sin\">mortal sin</a> for Apple’s leadership is losing sight of the <a href=\"#virtue\">proper relationship</a> between product virtue and financial success—and not just momentarily, but constitutionally, intransigently, for years. Sadly, I believe this has happened.</p>\n\n<p>The preponderance of the evidence is undeniable. Too many times, in too many ways, over too many years, Apple has made decisions that do <i>not</i> make its products better, all in service of control, leverage, protection, profits—all in service of <i>money</i>.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I don’t mean things like charging exorbitant prices for RAM and SSD upgrades on Macs or taking too high a percentage of in-app purchases in the App Store. Those are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venial_sin\">venial sins</a>. It’s the apparently unshakable core beliefs that <i>motivate</i> these and other poor decisions that run counter to the virtuous cycle that led Apple out of the darkness all those years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Apple, as embodied by its leadership’s decisions over the past decade or more, no longer seems primarily motivated by the creation of great products. Time and time again, its policies have made its products <i>worse</i> for customers in exchange for more power, control, and, yes, money for Apple.</p>\n\n<p>The iPhone is a <i>better product</i> when people can buy ebooks within the Kindle app. And yet Apple has fought this feature for the past <i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/technology/01apple.html\">fourteen years</a></i>, to the tune of millions of dollars in legal fees, and has only relented due to a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/661719/amazon-app-ios-apple-iphone-ipad-kindle-buy-books\">recent court order</a> (which they <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/661032/apple-epic-games-app-store-antitrust-ninth-circuit\">continue to appeal</a>).</p>\n\n<p>In the (Apple-mandated) absence of competition in the realms of app sales, payment processing, customer service, and software business models, Apple’s exclusive offerings in these areas have stagnated for years. What <i>should</i> be motivating Apple to make improvements—the desire to make great products—seems absent. What should <i>not</i> be motivating Apple—the desire for power, control, and profits—seems omnipresent.</p>\n\n<p>And I don’t mean that in a small way; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KdlJlHAAbQ\">I mean that in a big way</a>. Every new thing we learn about <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/apple/659296/apple-failed-compliance-court-ruling-breakdown\">Apple’s internal deliberations</a> surrounding these decisions only lends more weight to the conclusion that Apple has lost its north star. Or, rather, it has replaced it with a new, dark star. And time and again, we’ve learned that these decisions go all the way to the top.</p>\n\n<p>The best leaders can change their minds in response to new information. The best leaders can <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/05/04/tony-fadell-talks-about-steve-jobs-controversial-decisions-on-ipod-and-iphone-development/\">be persuaded</a>. But we’ve had decades of strife, lawsuits, and regulations, and Apple has stubbornly dug in its heels even further at every turn. It seems clear that there’s only one way to get a different result.</p>\n\n<p>In every healthy entity, whether it’s an organization, an institution, or an organism, the old is replaced by the new: CEOs, sovereigns, or cells. It’s time for new leadership at Apple. The road we’re on now does not lead anywhere good for Apple or its customers. It’s springtime, and I’m choosing to believe in new life. I swear it’s not too late.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><i>For more on this topic, see the follow-up article: <a href=\"/2025/05/20/apple-turnaround\">Apple Turnaround</a></i></p>",

The feature set of version 1.0 was intentionally very conservative. As I wrote in <a href=\"/2025/02/25/hyperspace\">my launch post</a>, Hyperspace modifies files that it did not create and does not own. This is an inherently risky proposition.</p>\n\n<p>The first release of Hyperspace mitigated these risks, in part, by entirely avoiding certain files and file system locations. I knew lifting these limitations would be a common request from potential customers. My plan was to launch 1.0 with the safest possible feature set, then slowly expand the app’s capabilities until all these intentional 1.0 limitations were gone.</p>\n\n<p>With the release of Hyperspace 1.3 earlier this week, I have accomplished that goal. Here’s the timeline for overcoming the three major 1.0 feature limitations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> 1.0: February 24, 2025 - Launch</li>\n<li> 1.1: March 14, 2025 - <b>Packages</b></li>\n<li> 1.2: April 3, 2025 - <b>Cloud storage</b></li>\n<li> 1.3: April 28, 2025 - <b>Libraries</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here’s an explanation of those limitations, why they existed, and what it took to overcome them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"packages\">Packages</h2>\n\n<p>A “package” is a directory that is presented to the user as a file. For example, an <kbd>.rtfd</kbd> document (a “Rich Text Document With Attachments”) created by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit\">TextEdit</a> is actually a directory that contains an <kbd>.rtf</kbd> file plus any attachments (e.g., images included in the document). The Finder displays and handles this <kbd>.rtfd</kbd> directory as if it were a single file.</p>\n\n<p>For a package to work, all its contents must be intact. Hyperspace works hard to handle and recover from all sorts of errors, but in the rare case that manual intervention is required, asking the user to fix a problem <i>within</i> a package is undesirable. Since packages appear as single files, most people are not accustomed to cracking them open and poking around in their guts.</p>\n\n<p>This may all seem esoteric, but there are some kinds of packages that are widely used and often contain vast amounts of data. Let’s start with the big one: Apple Photos libraries are packages. So are iMovie libraries, some Logic projects, and so on. These packages are all ideal targets for Hyperspace in terms of potential space savings. But they also often contain some of people’s most precious data.</p>\n\n<p>For the most part, files within packages don’t need to be treated any differently than “normal” files. The delay in lifting this limitation was to allow the app to mature a bit first. Though I had a very large set of beta testers, there’s nothing like real customer usage to find bugs and edge cases. After five 1.0.x releases, I finally felt confident enough in Hyperspace’s basic functionality to allow access to packages.</p>\n\n<p>I did so cautiously, however, by adding <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/hyperspace/#settings-advanced\">settings</a> to enable package access, but leaving them turned off by default. I also provided separate settings for scanning inside packages and reclaiming files within packages. Enabling scanning but not reclamation within packages allows files within packages to be used as “<a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/hyperspace/#source-file\">source files</a>”, which are never modified.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, macOS requires special permissions for accessing Photos libraries, so there’s a separate setting for that as well.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and there’s one more common package type that Hyperspace <i>still</i> ignores: applications (i.e., <kbd>.app</kbd> packages). The contents of app packages are subject to Apple’s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/code-signing-services/\">code signing</a> system and are very sensitive to changes. I still might tackle apps someday, but it hasn’t been a common customer request.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cloud-sorage\">Cloud Storage</h2>\n\n<p>Any file under the control of Apple’s “<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileprovider/synchronizing-files-using-file-provider-extensions\">file provider</a>” system is considered to be backed by cloud storage. In the past, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/icloud/\">iCloud Drive</a> was the only example. Today, third-party services also use Apple’s file provider system. Examples include <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage\">Microsoft OneDrive</a>, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive/answer/12178485?hl=en#File-Provider\">Google Drive</a>, and <a href=\"https://help.dropbox.com/installs/macos-support-for-expected-changes\">some versions</a> of <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There’s always the potential for competition between Hyperspace and other processes when accessing a given file. But in the case of cloud storage, we <i>know</i> there’s some other process that has its eye on every cloud-backed file. Hyperspace must tread lightly. Also, files backed by cloud storage might not actually be fully downloaded to the local disk. And even if they are, they might not be up-to-date.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike files within packages, files backed by cloud storage are <i>not</i> just like other files. They require special treatment using different APIs. After nailing down “normal” file handling, including files within packages, I was ready to tackle cloud storage.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, there were no major problems. Apple’s APIs for wrangling cloud-backed files mostly seem to work, with only a few oddities. And if Hyperspace can’t get an affirmative assurance from those APIs that a file is a valid candidate for reclamation, it will err on the side of caution and skip the file instead.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"libraries\">Libraries</h2>\n\n<p>In the early years of <a href=\"/2015/04/15/os-x-reviewed\">Mac OS X</a>, there were tragicomic tales of users finding a folder named “Library” in their home directory and deciding they didn’t need it or its contents, then moving them to the Trash. Today, macOS hides that folder by default—for good reason. Its contents are essential for the correct functionality of your Mac! The same goes for the “Library” directory at the top level of the boot volume.</p>\n\n<p>Hyperspace avoided Library folders for so long because their contents are so important, and because those contents are updated with surprising frequency. As with packages, it was important for me to have confidence in the basic functionality of Hyperspace before I declared open season on Library folders.</p>\n\n<p>This capability was added last because the other two were more highly requested. As usual, Library access is enabled with a setting, which is off by default. Due to the high potential for contention (running apps are constantly fiddling with their files within the Library folder), this is probably the riskiest of the three major features, which is another reason I saved it for last. I might not have added it at all, if not for the fact that Library folders are a surprisingly rich source for space savings.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"future\">The Future</h2>\n\n<p>There’s more to come, including user interface improvements and an attempt to overcome some of the limitations of <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app-sandbox\">sandboxing</a>, potentially allowing Hyperspace to reclaim space across more than one user account. (That last one is a bit of a “stretch goal”, but I’ve <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/switchglass/#quit\">done it before</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>If you want to know more about how Hyperspace works, <a href=\"/hyperspace/#help\">please read the extensive documentation</a>. If you're interested in beta testing future versions of Hyperspace, <a href=\"mailto:switchglass@hypercritical.co?subject=SwitchGlass TestFlight membership\">email me</a>.</p>\n\n<p id=\"never-a-straight-line\">In some ways, Hyperspace version 1.3 is what I originally envisioned when I started the project. But <a href=\"/frame-game/#10-full\" id=\"never-a-straight-line-link\">software development is never a straight line</a>. It’s a forest. And like a forest it’s easy to lose your way. Launching with a more limited version 1.0 led to some angry reviews and low ratings in the Mac App Store, but it made the app safer from day one, and ultimately better for every user, now and in the future.</p>\n\n<audio id=\"never-a-straight-line-audio\" src=\"/2025/05/01/sounds/never-a-straight-line.mp3\" preload=\"auto\" style=\"display:none;\"></audio>\n",

It shows a woman in a space suit on a yellow-tinted planet looking anxious ane expectant.\"></div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80174608\">Love, Death &amp; Robots</a> is an animated anthology series on Netflix. Each episode is a standalone story, though there is the barest of cross-season continuity in the form of one story featuring characters from a past season.</p>\n\n<p>I love animation, but I’m hesitant to recommend Love, Death &amp; Robots to casual viewers for a couple of reasons. First, this show is not for kids. It features a lot of violence, gore, nudity, and sex. That’s not what most people expect from animation.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the quality is uneven. I don’t mean the quality of the animation, which is usually excellent. I mean how well they work as stories. Each episode has only a ten- to fifteen-minute runtime, during which it has to introduce its characters, its (usually sci-fi) setting, and then tell a satisfying story. It’s a challenging format.</p>\n\n<p>Three seasons of Love, Death &amp; Robots have been released since 2019. With <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/645329/netflix-love-death-and-robots-season-4-trailer-release-date\">season four set to debut in May</a>, I thought I’d take a shot at convincing more people to give this show a chance. This is a rare case where I <i>don’t</i> recommend starting with season 1, episode 1 and viewing in order. The not-so-great episodes will surely drive most people away. Instead, I’m going to tell you where the gems are.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s my list of the very best episodes of Love, Death &amp; Robots in seasons 1–3. They’re standalone stories, so you can watch them in any order, but (back on brand) I do recommend that you watch them in the order listed below.</p>\n\n<p>One last warning: Though not every episode is filled with gore and violence, most of them are—often including sexual violence. If this is not something you want to see, then I still recommend watching the handful of episodes that avoid these things. Remember, each episode is a standalone story, so watching even just one is fine.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80223965?trackId=14277283\">Sonnie’s Edge</a></b> (Season 1, Episode 1) - This is a perfect introduction to the series. It’s grim, violent, gory, beautifully animated, but with some unexpected emotional resonance.</p></li>\n\n<li> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80223967?trackId=14277283\">Three Robots</a></b> (Season 1, Episode 2) - The characters introduced in this story have become the unofficial mascots of the series. You’ll be seeing them again. The episode is lighthearted, cute, and undercut by a decidedly grim setting.</p></li>\n\n<li> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80223956?trackId=14277283\">Good Hunting</a></b> (Season 1, Episode 8) - Yes, traditional 2D animation is still a thing! But don’t expect something Disney-like. This story combines fantasy, myth, sci-fi, sex, love, death, and…well, cyborgs, at least.</p></li>\n\n<li> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80223964?trackId=14277283\">Lucky 13</a></b> (Season 1, Episode 13) - If you like sci-fi action as seen in movies like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/aliens/\">Aliens</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/edge-of-tomorrow/\">Edge of Tomorrow</a>, this is the episode for you. As expected for this series, there’s a bit of a cerebral and emotional accent added to the stock sci-fi action.</p></li>\n\n<li> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80223962\">Zima Blue</a></b> (Season 1, Episode 14) - This is my favorite episode of the series, but it’s a weird one. I’m sure it doesn’t work at all for some people, but it got me. There’s no violence, sex, or gore—just a single, simple idea artfully realized.</p></li>\n\n<li> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81253138\">Snow in the Desert</a></b> (Season 2, Episode 4) - There’s a full movie’s worth of story crammed into this 18-minute episode, including some nice world-building and a lot of familiar themes and story beats. There’s nothing unexpected, but the level of execution is very high.</p></li>\n\n<li> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81424941\">Three Robots: Exit Strategies</a></b> (Season 3, Episode 1) - Our lovable robot friends are at it again, with an extra dose of black humor.</p></li>\n\n<li> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81424938\">Bad Travelling</a></b> (Season 3, Episode 2) - Lovecraftian horror on the high seas. It’s extremely dark and extremely gross.</p></li>\n\n<li> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81424935\">The Very Pulse of the Machine</a></b> (Season 3, Episode 3) - I guess I like the sappy, weird ones the best, because this is my second-favorite episode. It combines the kind of sci-fi ideas usually only encountered in novels with an emotional core. The animation is a beautiful blend of 3D modeling and cel shading. (As seen in <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/2022/04/25/frame-game\">Frame Game</a> <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/frame-game/#75-full\">#75</a>)</p></li>\n\n<li> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81424936\">Swarm</a></b> (Season 3, Episode 6) - I’ll see your Aliens-style sci-fi and raise you one pile of <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/entomophobia\">entomophobia</a> and body horror. Upsetting and creepy.</p></li>\n\n<li> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81424931\">In Vaulted Halls Entombed</a></b> (Season 3, Episode 8) - “Space marines” meets Cthulhu. It goes about as well as you’d expect for our heroes.</p></li>\n\n<li> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81424939\">Jibaro</a></b> (Season 3, Episode 9) - The animation style in this episode is <i>bonkers</i>. I have never seen anything like it. The story, such as it is, is slight. This episode makes the list entirely based on its visuals, which are upsetting and baffling and amazing in equal measure. I’m not sure I even “like” this episode, but man, is it something.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’ve read all this and still can’t tell which are the “safest” episodes for those who want to avoid gore, sex, and violence, I’d recommend <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80223967?trackId=14277283\">Three Robots</a> (S1E2), <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80223962\">Zima Blue</a> (S1E14), <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81424941\">Three Robots: Exit Strategies</a> (S3E1), and <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81424935\">The Very Pulse of the Machine</a> (S3E3). But remember, none of these episodes are really suitable for children.</p>\n\n<p>If you watch and enjoy any of these, then check out the rest of the episodes in the series. You may find some that you like more than any of my favorites.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you see these episodes in a different order in your Netflix client, the explanation is that Netflix rearranges episodes based on your viewing habits and history. Each person may see a different episode order within Netflix. Since viewing order doesn’t really matter in an anthology series, this doesn’t change much, but it is unexpected and, I think, ill-advised. Regardless, the links above should take you directly to each episode.</p>\n\n<p>I’m so excited that a series like this even exists. It reminds me of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Television\">Liquid Television</a> from my teen years: a secret cache of odd, often willfully transgressive animation hiding in plain sight on a mainstream media platform. They’re not all winners, but I treasure the ones that succeed on their own terms.</p>",

In the late 1990s, when it <a href=\"/2025/02/25/images/macworld-february-1997.jpg\">looked like</a> Apple might buy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Inc.\">Be Inc.</a> to solve its operating system problems, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_File_System\">Be File System</a> was the part I was <a href=\"http://nobius.org/~dbg/practical-file-system-design.pdf\">most excited</a> about. When Apple bought NeXT instead and (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhapsody_(operating_system)\">eventually</a>) created Mac OS X, I was <a href=\"/fatbits/2005/11/21/whos-minding-the-store\">extremely</a> <a href=\"/fatbits/2005/12/09/zfs-data-integrity-explained\">enthusiastic</a> about the <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2007/06/07/apple_using_zfs_in_leopard/\">possibility</a> of ZFS becoming the new file system for the Mac. But that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/06/zfs-the-other-new-apple-file-system-that-almost-was-until-it-wasnt/\">didn’t happen</a> either.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, at WWDC 2017, Apple announced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System\">Apple File System</a> (APFS) for macOS (after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcyaadNy9Jk&t=1670s\">secretly test-converting everyone’s iPhones to APFS and then reverting them back to HFS+</a> as part of an earlier iOS 10.x update in one of the most audacious technological gambits in history).</p>\n\n<p>APFS wasn’t ZFS, but it was still a huge leap over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus\">HFS+</a>. Two of its most important features are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_(computer_storage)\">point-in-time snapshots</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write#In_computer_storage\">copy-on-write</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System#Clones\">clones</a>. Snapshots allow for more reliable and efficient <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS)\">Time Machine</a> backups. Copy-on-write clones are based on the same underlying architectural features that enable snapshots: a flexible arrangement between directory entries and their corresponding file contents.</p>\n\n<p>Today, most Mac users don’t even notice that using the “Duplicate” command in the Finder to make a copy of a file doesn’t actually copy the file’s contents. Instead, it makes a “clone” file that shares its data with the original file. That’s why duplicating a file in the Finder is nearly instant, no matter how large the file is.</p>\n\n<p>Despite knowing about clone files since the APFS introduction nearly eight years ago, I didn’t give them much thought beyond the tiny thrill of knowing that I wasn’t eating any more disk space when I duplicated a large file in the Finder. But late last year, as my Mac’s disk slowly filled, I started to muse about how I might be able to get some disk space back.</p>\n\n<p>If I could find files that had the same content but were <i>not</i> clones of each other, I could convert them into clones that all shared a single instance of the data on disk. I took an afternoon to whip up a Perl script (that called out to a command-line tool written in C and another written in Swift) to run against my disk to see how much space I might be able to save by doing this. It turned out to be a lot: dozens of gigabytes.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, there was no turning back. I had to make this into an app. There are plenty of Mac apps that will save disk space by finding duplicate files and then <i>deleting</i> the duplicates. Using APFS clones, my app could reclaim disk space <i><a href=\"/hyperspace/#without-removing\">without removing any files</a>!</i> As a digital pack rat, this appealed to me immensely.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of that week, I’d written a barebones Mac app to do the same thing my Perl script was doing. In the months that followed, I polished and tested the app, and christened it <a href=\"/hyperspace/\">Hyperspace</a>. I’m happy to announce that Hyperspace is now available in the Mac App Store.</p>\n\n<div class=\"image center\" style=\"margin:-6%;\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyperspace-reclaim-disk-space/id6739505345?mt=12\"><img src=\"/2025/02/25/images/hyperspace-icon-1024-lossy.png\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" alt=\"The Hyperspace app icon, created by Iconfactory\" title=\"The Hyperspace app icon, created by Iconfactory\"></a></div>\n\n<p class=\"app-store-badge\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyperspace-reclaim-disk-space/id6739505345?mt=12\"><img src=\"/images/download-on-mac-app-store.svg\" height=\"40\" alt=\"Download Hyperspace from the Mac App Store\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Hyperspace is a free download, and it’s free to scan to see how much space you might save. To actually reclaim any of that space, you will have to <a href=\"/hyperspace/#purchase\">pay for the app</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Like <a href=\"/apps/\">all my apps</a>, Hyperspace is a bit difficult to explain. I’ve attempted to do so, at length, in the <a href=\"/hyperspace/\">Hyperspace documentation</a>. I hope it makes enough sense to enough people that it will be a useful addition to the Mac ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>For my fellow developers who might be curious, this is my second Mac app that uses SwiftUI and my first that uses the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/migrating-to-the-swiftui-life-cycle\">SwiftUI life cycle</a>. It’s also my second app to use Swift 6 and my first to do so since very early in its development. I found it <i>much</i> easier to use Swift 6 from (nearly) the start than to convert an existing, released app to Swift 6. Even so, there are still many rough edges to Swift 6, and I look forward to things being <a href=\"https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/visions/approachable-concurrency.md\">smoothed</a> <a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@holly/114039272702099974\">out</a> a bit in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://atp.fm/617\">a recent episode of ATP</a>, I described the then-unnamed Hyperspace as “<a href=\"https://atp.fm/617\">An Incredibly Dangerous App</a>.” Like the process of converting from HFS+ to APFS, Hyperspace modifies files that it did not create and does not own. It is, by far, the riskiest app I’ve created. (Reclaiming disk space ain’t like dusting crops…) But I also think it might be the most useful to the largest number of people. I hope you like it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:2025-02-25-1\"><p>Please note that type and creator codes are <i>not</i> stored in the resource fork. <a href=\"#fnref:2025-02-25-1\" title=\"return to article\">↩</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

Here’s a brief review for those of you who are (blessedly) unaware of this issue. Messages sent using the iMessage service appear in blue text bubbles within the Messages app. Messages sent using something other than the iMessage service (e.g., <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS\">SMS</a>, or (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23964851/rcs-bubbles-on-the-iphone-will-be-green\">soon</a>) RCS) appear in green text bubbles.</p>\n\n<p>The iMessage service and the Messages app are only available on Apple devices. This is usually presented as a competitive advantage for the iPhone. If you want to use the iMessage service, the only (legitimate) way to do so is to buy an Apple device. If Apple were to make iMessage available on non-Apple platforms, that would remove one reason to buy an iPhone—or so the argument goes.</p>\n\n<p>I think this popular conception of the issue is slightly wrong—or right for a different reason, at least. The iMessage service is not so good that it makes the iPhone more attractive to customers. It’s the <i>iPhone</i> that makes <i>iMessage</i> attractive. The iPhone gives iMessage its cachet, not the other way around.</p>\n\n<p>This truth is plainly evident at the core of the “blue bubbles vs. green bubbles” debate. One of the biggest reasons green bubbles are looked down upon is that they indicate that the recipient doesn’t have an iPhone. iPhones are expensive, fancy, and desirable. Blue bubbles put the sender into the “in” crowd of iPhone owners.</p>\n\n<p>The iMessage service itself, when considered in isolation, has considerably less draw. Here’s an assessment from 2013 from within Apple, as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406303/imessage-android-eddy-cue-emails-apple-epic-deposition\">revealed</a> during the recent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Apple\">Epic trial</a> by internal emails discussing the idea of making iMessage work on non-Apple devices.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_Cue\">Eddy Cue</a>: We have the best messaging app and we should make it the industry standard. […]</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Federighi\">Craig Federighi</a>: Do you have any thoughts on how we would make switching to iMessage (from WhatsApp) compelling to masses of Android users who don’t have a bunch of iOS friends? iMessage is a nice app/service, but to get users to switch social networks we’d need more than a marginally better app.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While I appreciate Eddy’s enthusiasm, I think Craig is closer to the mark: if iMessage is better than its competitors at all—and this is highly debatable—it is only marginally so.</p>\n\n<p>Those Apple emails were written more than a decade ago. In the years since, iMessage has improved, but so has the competition. Today, it still feels like the iPhone is carrying iMessage. Anecdotally, both my teenage children have iPhones, but their group chats with their friends take place in WhatsApp.</p>\n\n<p>Apple has almost certainly missed the most advantageous window of time to make iMessage “the industry standard” messaging service. But as the <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2021/12/29/plant-tree/\">old saying goes</a>, the best time to plant a tree is 30 years ago, and the second-best time is now. Apple has little to lose by expanding iMessage to other platforms, and there still may be something to be gained (even if it’s just making mixed Android/iPhone conversations in Messages a bit more smooth).</p>",

It shows a somewhat abstract black-and-white image of the Sierra(?) mountain range with the sun setting behind it.\"></div>\n\n<p>The graphical user interface on the original Macintosh was a revelation to me when I first used it at the tender age of 8 years old. Part of the magic was thanks to its use of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_manipulation_interface\">direct manipulation</a>.\" This term was coined in the 1980s to describe the ability to control a computer without using the keyboard to explain what you wanted it to do. Instead of typing a command to move a file from one place to another, the user could just grab it and drag it to a new location.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that I’m able to write the phrase “grab it and drag it to a new location” and most people  will understand what I mean is a testament to the decades-long success of this kind of interface. In the context of personal computers like the Mac, we all understand what it means to “grab” something on the screen and drag it somewhere using a mouse. We understand that the little pictures represent things that have meaning to both us and the computer, and we know what it means to manipulate them in certain ways. For most of us, it has become second nature.</p>\n\n<p>With the advent of the iPhone and ubiquitous touchscreen interfaces, the phrase “direct manipulation” is now used to draw a contrast between touch interfaces and Mac-style GUIs. The <i>iPhone</i> has “direct manipulation.” The Mac does not. On an iPhone, you literally touch the thing you want to manipulate with your actual finger—no “indirect” pointing device needed.</p>\n\n<p>The magic, the attractiveness, the fundamental <i>success</i> of both of these forms of “direct manipulation” has a lot to do with the physical reality of our existence as human beings. The ability to reason about and manipulate objects in space is a cornerstone of our success as a species. It is an essential part of every aspect of our lives. Millions of years of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection\">natural selection</a> has made these skills a foundational component of our very being. We need these skills to survive, and so all of us survivors are the ones who have these skills.</p>\n\n<p>Compare this with the things we often put under the umbrella of “knowing how to use computers”: debugging Wi-Fi problems, understanding how formulas work in Excel, splitting a bezier curve in Illustrator, converting a color image to black and white in Photoshop, etc. These are all things we must learn how to do specifically for the purpose of using the computer. There has not been millions of years of reproductive selection to help produce a modern-day population that inherently knows how to convert a PDF into a Word document. Sure, the ability to reason and learn is in our genes, but the ability to perform any specific task on a computer is not.</p>\n\n<p>Given this, interfaces that leverage the innate abilities we <i>do</i> have are incredibly powerful. They have lower <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load\">cognitive load</a>. They <i>feel</i> good. “Ease of use” was what we called it in the 1980s.</p>\n\n<p>The success of the GUI was driven, in large part, by the fact that our entire lives—and the lives of all our ancestors—have prepared us with many of the skills necessary to work with interfaces where we see things and then use our hands to manipulate them. The “indirection” of the GUI—icons that represent files, windows that represent documents that scroll within their frames—fades away very quickly. The mechanical functions of interaction become second nature, allowing us to concentrate on figuring out how the heck to remove the borders on a table in Google Docs<sup id=\"fnref:2024-01-30-1\"><a href=\"#fn:2024-01-30-1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, or whatever.</p>\n\n<p>The more a user interface presents a world that is understandable to us, where we can flex our millennia-old kinesthetic skills, the better it feels. The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2003/04/finder/\">Spatial Finder</a>, which had a simple, direct relationship between each Finder window and a location in the file hierarchy, was a defining part of the classic Macintosh interface. Decades later, the iPhone launched with a similarly relentlessly spatial home-screen interface: a grid of icons, recognizable by their position and appearance, that go where we move them and stay where we put them.</p>\n\n<p>Now here we are, 40 years after <a href=\"https://www.folklore.org\">the original Macintosh</a>, and Apple is introducing what it calls its first \"<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/\">spatial computer</a>.\" I haven’t tried the Vision Pro yet (regular customers won’t receive theirs for at least another three days), but the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GkPw6ScHyb4\">early</a> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hdwaWxY11jQ\">reviews</a> and Apple’s own <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/guided-tour/\">guided tour</a> provide a good overview of its capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>How does the Vision Pro stack up, spatially speaking? Is it the <i>new</i> definition of “direct manipulation,” wresting the title from touch interfaces? In one obvious way, it takes spatial interfaces to the next level by committing to the simulation of a 3D world in a much more thorough way than the Mac or iPhone. Traditional GUIs are often described as being “2D,” but they’ve all taken advantage of our ability to parse and understand objects in 3D space by layering interface elements on top of each other, often deploying visual cues like shadows to drive home the illusion.</p>\n\n<p>Vision Pro’s commitment to the bit goes much further. It breaks the rigid perpendicularity and shallow overall depth of the layered windows in a traditional GUI to provide a much deeper (literally) world within which to do our work.</p>\n\n<p>Where Vision Pro may stumble is in its interface to the deep, spatial world it provides. We all know how to reach out and “directly manipulate” objects in the real world, but that’s not what Vision Pro asks us to do. Instead, Vision Pro requires us to first look at the thing we want to manipulate, and then perform an “indirect” gesture with our hands to operate on it.</p>\n\n<p>Is this look-then-gesture interaction any different than using a mouse to “indirectly” manipulate a pointer? Does it leverage our innate spatial abilities to the same extent? Time will tell. But I feel comfortable saying that, in some ways, this kind of Vision Pro interaction is less “direct” than the iPhone’s touch interface, where we see a thing on a screen and then literally place our fingers on it. Will there be any interaction on the Vision Pro that’s as intuitive, efficient, and satisfying as flick-scrolling on an iPhone screen? It’s a high bar to clear, that’s for sure.</p>\n\n<p>As the Vision Pro finally starts to arrive in customers’ hands, I can’t help but view it through this spatial-interface lens when comparing it to the Mac and the iPhone. Both its predecessors took advantage of our abilities to recognize and manipulate objects in space to a greater extent than any of the computing platforms that came before them. In its current form, I’m not sure the same can be said of the Vision Pro.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there’s a lot more to the Vision Pro than the degree to which it taps into this specific set of human skills. Its ability to fill literally the entire space around the user with its interface is something the Mac and iPhone cannot match, and it opens the door to new experiences and new kinds of interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>But I do wonder if the Vision Pro’s current interaction model will hold up as well as that of the Mac and iPhone. Perhaps there’s still at least one technological leap yet to come to round out the story. Or perhaps the tools of the past (e.g., physical keyboards and pointing devices) will end up being an essential part of a productive, efficient Vision Pro experience. No matter how it turns out, I’m happy to see that the decades-old journey of “spatial computing” continues.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:2024-01-30-1\"><p>Select the whole table, then click the “Border width” toolbar icon, then select <code>0pt</code>. <a href=\"#fnref:2024-01-30-1\" title=\"return to article\">↩</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

I’m not a lawyer, and I’m not sure how the many <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/27/24016212/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit-copyright-infringement\">current</a> and future legal battles related to this topic will shake out. Right now, I’m still trying to understand the issue well enough to form a coherent opinion of how things <i>should</i> be. Writing this post is part of my process.</p>\n\n<p>Generative AI needs to be trained on a vast amount of data that represents the kinds of things it will be asked to generate. The connection between that training data and the eventual generated output is a hotly debated topic. An AI model has no value until it’s trained. After training, how much of the model’s value is attributable to any given piece of training data? What legal rights, if any, can the owners of that training data exert on the creator of the model or its output?</p>\n\n<p>A human’s creative work is inextricably linked to their life experiences: every piece of art they’ve ever seen, everything they’ve done, everyone they’ve ever met. And yet we still say the creative output of humans is worthy of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright\">legal protection</a> (with some fairly narrow restrictions for works that are deemed insufficiently differentiated from existing works).</p>\n\n<p>Some say that generative AI is no different. Its output is inextricably linked to its “life experience” (training data). Everything it creates is influenced by everything it has ever seen. It’s doing the same thing a human does, so why shouldn’t its output be treated the same as a human’s output?</p>\n\n<p>And if it generates output that’s insufficiently differentiated from some existing work, well, we already have laws to handle that. But if not, then it’s in the clear. There’s no need for any sort of financial arrangement with the owners of the training data any more than an artist needs to pay every other artist whose work she’s seen each time she makes a new painting.</p>\n\n<p>This argument does not sit well for me, for both practical and ethical reasons. Practically speaking, generative AI changes the economics and timescales of the market for creative works in a way that has the potential to disincentivize non-AI-generated art, both by making creative careers less viable and by narrowing the scope of creative skill that is valued by the market. Even if generative AI develops to the point where it is self-sustaining without (further) human input, the act of creation is an essential part of a life well-lived. Humans need to create, and we must foster a market that supports this.</p>\n\n<p>Ethically, the argument that generative AI is “just doing what humans do” seems to draw an equivalence between computer programs and humans that doesn’t feel right to me. It was the pursuit of this feeling that led me to a key question at the center of this debate.</p>\n\n<p>Computer programs don’t have rights<sup id=\"fnref:2024-01-11-1\"><a href=\"#fn:2024-01-11-1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, but people who use computer programs do. No one is suggesting that generative AI models should somehow have the rights to the things they create. It’s the humans using these AI models that are making claims about the output—either that they, the human, should own the output, or, at the very least, that the owners of the model’s training data should <i>not</i> have any rights to the output.</p>\n\n<p>After all, what’s the difference between using generative AI to create a picture and using Photoshop? They’re both computer programs that help humans make more, better creative works in less time, right?</p>\n\n<p>We’ve always had technology that empowers human creativity: pencils, paintbrushes, rulers, compasses, quills, typewriters, word processors, bitmapped and vector drawing programs—thousands of years of technological enhancement of creativity. Is generative AI any different?</p>\n\n<p>At the heart of this question is the act of creation itself. Ownership and rights hinge on that act of creation. Who owns a creative work? Not the pencil, not the typewriter, not Adobe Photoshop. It’s the human who used those tools to create the work that owns it.</p>\n\n<p>There can, of course, be legal arrangements to transfer ownership of the work created by one human to another human (or a legal entity like a corporation). And in this way, value is exchanged, forming a market for creativity.</p>\n\n<p>Now then, when someone uses generative AI, who is the creator? Is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering\">writing the prompt</a> for the generative AI the act of creation, thus conferring ownership of the output to the prompt-writer without any additional legal arrangements?</p>\n\n<p>Suppose Bob writes an email to Sue, who has no existing business relationship with Bob, asking her to draw a picture of a polar bear wearing a cowboy hat while riding a bicycle. If Sue draws this picture, we all agree that Sue is the creator, and that some arrangement is required to transfer ownership of this picture to Bob. But if Bob types that same email into a generative AI, has he now become the creator of the generated image? If not, then who is the creator?</p>\n\n<p>Where is the act of creation?</p>\n\n<p>This question is at the emotional, ethical (and possibly legal) heart of the generative AI debate. I’m reminded of the <a href=\"https://nedroidcomics.tumblr.com/post/41879001445/the-internet\">well-known web comic</a> in which one person hands something to another and says, “I made this.” The recipient accepts the item, saying “You made this?” The recipient then holds the item silently for a moment while the person who gave them the item departs. In the final frame of the comic, the recipient stands alone holding the item and says, “I made this.”</p>\n\n<p>This comic resonates with people for many reasons. To me, the key is the second frame in which the recipient holds the item alone. It’s in that moment that possession of the item convinces the person that they own it. After all, they’re holding it. It’s theirs! And if they own it, and no one else is around, then they must have created it!</p>\n\n<p>This leads me back to the same question. Where is the act of creation? The person in the comic would rather not think about it. But generative AI is forcing us all to do so.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not focused on this point for reasons of fairness or tradition. Technology routinely changes markets. Our job as a society is to ensure that technology changes things for the better in the long run, while mitigating the inevitable short-term harm.</p>\n\n<p>Every new technology has required new laws to ensure that it becomes and remains a net good for society. It’s rare that we can successfully adapt existing laws to fully manage a new technology, especially one that has the power to radically alter the shape of an existing market like generative AI does.</p>\n\n<p>In its current state, generative AI breaks the value chain between creators and consumers. We don’t have to reconnect it in exactly the same way it was connected before, but we also can’t just leave it dangling. The historical practice of conferring ownership based on the act of creation still seems sound, but that means we must be able to unambiguously identify that act. And if the same act (absent any prior legal arrangements) confers ownership in one context but not in another, then perhaps it’s not the best candidate.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure what the right answer is, but I think I’m getting closer to the right question. It’s a question I think we’re all going to encounter a lot more frequently in the future: Who made this?</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:2024-01-11-1\"><p><i>Non-sentient</i> computer programs, that is.

While <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">its</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">competitors</a> were fighting for supremacy in the game-console market by producing ever-more-powerful hardware capable of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television\">high-definition</a> visuals, Nintendo chose not to join this fight. The pursuit of graphics power was a “red ocean” that was already teeming with sharks, fighting over the available fish and filling the water with blood.</p>\n\n<p>Nintendo’s “blue ocean” strategy was to stake out a position where none of its competitors were present. The idea of creating a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-definition_television\">standard-definition</a> game console in the generation when all the other consoles were moving to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television\">HD</a> seemed ridiculous, but that’s exactly what Nintendo did. In place of impressive graphics, the Wii differentiated itself with its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii#Wii_Remote\">motion controls</a> and a low price. It was <a href=\"/2013/02/24/images/who-dares-wins.jpg\">a hit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Lately, I’ve been thinking about the blue ocean strategy in the context of Apple. Like Nintendo, Apple has made some bold moves with its products, many of which were ridiculed at the time: a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone\">smartphone without a physical keyboard</a>, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac\">candy-colored desktop computer</a> with no floppy drive and no legacy ports, a $695 (in 2023 dollars) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod\">portable music player</a>, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store\">digital music store</a> in the age of ubiquitous music piracy.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Nintendo, Apple has seen its competitors move quickly to imitate its innovations, turning these oceans red and leaving Apple to compete on the basis of execution…until it finds its next blue ocean.</p>\n\n<p>But what is that? It’s tempting to point to the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/\">Vision Pro</a>. AR/VR headsets are not new, but then, neither were smartphones or portable music players. The Vision Pro hasn’t shipped yet, so the jury’s still out. Let’s keep an eye on it.</p>\n\n<p>I have something else in mind. It’s actually related to one of Apple’s earlier \"blue ocean\" changes: the elimination of removable batteries. In the beginning, Apple’s laptops all used removable battery packs. <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g3/specs/powerbook_g3_233.html\">Some</a> even let the user pull out the floppy-drive module and replace it with a second battery.</p>\n\n<p>Starting in <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-2-duo-2.66-aluminum-17-early-2009-unibody-specs.html\">2009</a>, Apple began to phase out removable batteries across its laptop line in favor of batteries that were sealed inside the case and were not user-accessible. The iPod and the iPhone arguably started this trend by never including removable batteries to begin with. (The iPhone defied so many other norms that the sealed battery was less remarked upon than it might have been, but it was still noted.)</p>\n\n<p>The upsides, which Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/01/06Apple-Introduces-17-inch-MacBook-Pro-With-Revolutionary-New-Built-in-Battery-That-Delivers-Eight-Hours-of-Use-1-000-Recharges/\">touted</a>, were many: lighter weight, smaller size, better reliability, longer battery life. We are still reaping these benefits today, and we Apple fans rarely question them. Today, predictably, non-removable batteries are a red ocean in many product categories. They are the norm, not an innovation.</p>\n\n<p>When thinking about Apple’s next blue ocean, it’s tempting to ignore past innovations. Technological progress seems like an arrow pointing in only one direction, never turning back. But I just can’t shake the idea that a return to removable, user-accessible batteries has now become a blue-ocean opportunity just waiting for Apple to seize it.</p>\n\n<p>Follow me, here. Yes, sealed batteries still offer all the same advantages they always have. And, yes, a return to removable batteries would bring back all their problems: increased size and weight, increased risk of liquid and dust ingress, decreased aesthetic elegance.</p>\n\n<p>But some things have changed in the past couple of decades. Battery technology has improved, and Apple has moved its entire product line to its own silicon chips that lead the industry in power efficiency. There’s more headroom than there has ever been to accommodate a tiny bit more size and weight in Apple’s portable products.</p>\n\n<p>That’s still a step backwards, right? But there are several countervailing forces, one of which is rapidly increasing in importance. The first is the fact that, as noted earlier, removable batteries are now a blue ocean. Apple would be alone among its biggest competitors if it made a wholesale change (back) to removable batteries in any of its product lines.</p>\n\n<p>Second, people still crave the <i>advantages</i> of removable batteries that were left behind: increasing battery life by swapping batteries instead of using a cumbersome external battery pack, inexpensively and conveniently extending the life of a product by replacing a worn-out battery with a new one—without paying for someone else to perform delicate surgery on the device.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, related to that last point, worn-out batteries are an extremely common reason that old tech products are traded in, recycled, or replaced. Removable batteries are an easy way to extend the useful life of a product. This leads to less <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste\">e-waste</a>, which is perfectly aligned with <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/environment/\">Apple’s environmental goals</a> as <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/07/apple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030/\">2030 approaches</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, longer product lifetimes means fewer product sales per unit time, which seems to run counter to Apple’s <i>financial</i> goals. But this is a problem that can be solved using one of Apple’s favorite financial tools: higher product margins. If Apple can actually make products that have a longer useful life, it can charge more money for the extra value they provide.</p>\n\n<p>It’s easy to think of product ideas that run counter to accepted wisdom; it’s harder to think of the <i>right</i> one. Sometimes a blue ocean is free from sharks simply because there are no fish there. But I think this idea has merit. I am not making a prediction, but I am making a suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>I know some of you remain unconvinced. How can a removable battery be easy to swap and yet also be sealed against the elements? Won’t removable batteries ruin the appearance of Apple’s existing products by adding unsightly cut lines? Won’t they become unacceptably large and heavy? How can <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/24/17389220/apple-bendgate-internal-documents-iphone-6-plus\">structural integrity</a> be maintained with a giant hole cut out of the product frame? What about the risk of fire due to faulty battery connections or battery packs coming in contact with something metal in someone’s pocket?

(This can occur in any work of fiction, of course: movies, TV, books, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Here’s an example. A plumber is watching a movie with a scene where something having to do with pipes is integral to the plot. But it’s all wrong, and the plumber’s mind rebels. No one else in the audience is bothered. They’re all still wrapped up in the narrative. But the plumber has a problem.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure how long ago I came up with this phrase. The earliest recorded occurrence I can find is from 2021, in <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/rd/153\">episode #153 of Reconcilable Differences</a> (<a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+E5IOGS27o/47:02\">at 47:02</a>) where I explain it to my cohost, <a href=\"http://www.merlinmann.com\">Merlin</a>, so it obviously predates that.</p>\n\n<p>The Plumber Problem is loosely related to the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton#GellMannAmnesiaEffect\">Gell-Mann amnesia effect</a>” which is “the phenomenon of experts believing news articles written on topics outside of their fields of expertise, yet acknowledging that articles written in the same publication within their fields of expertise are error-ridden and full of misunderstanding.”\n\n<p>Anyway, I was thinking about this today thanks to some people on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social\">Mastodon</a> sending <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@siracusa\">me</a> examples of The Plumber Problem. Here are a few (lightly edited):</p>\n\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@snowdolphin/110905581273831250\">Simon Orrell</a>: My first exposure to “The Plumber Problem” was sitting in a theatre with my dad in 1973 watching “Emperor of the North” and my dad leans over to whisper, “They didn’t make culvert pipe like that back in the ’30s. It was plate, not corrugated.”</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://sfba.social/@kalong/110908035186703085\">Tim Allen</a>: In Speed 2, a plot point involves a laden oil tanker about to collide explosively. My wife, native to a major oil port city, couldn’t follow the plot because she could tell the tanker was empty just by looking at it, so she didn’t understand why everyone was saying it would explode.</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://vmst.io/@DanMorgan/110910521055493784\">Dan Morgan</a>: Interstellar’s farming scenes were just <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/ek1ln7/in_interstellar_2014_there_are_numerous_scenes_of/\" class=\"stealth\">SO BAD</a>.

I’m sure the physics were fine though. 😂</blockquote>\n\n<p>Someone also <a href=\"https://vis.social/@gretared/110907538291037006\">mentioned</a> that “The Plumber Problem” is not an easy phrase to look up online, so here’s hoping this post remedies that situation.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here’s one more bonus post that I enjoyed:</p>\n\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://social.lol/@daisy55/110911857615301788\">magic</a>: In Star Wars, Luke turns off his targeting computer to use the Force for his attack run on the Death Star.

The <a href=\"/2018/06/15/hypercritical-t-shirts-return\">last sale</a> was in 2018, so the time has come! This sale ends on Saturday, August 12th, so if you want a shirt, don’t delay. Last time, I hinted that it would be five years before the shirts were sold again, and some people didn’t believe me. But it was true then, and it’s true now. If you want a shirt, buy it now, or resign yourself to waiting until 2028!</p>\n\n<p>The shirts are available in men’s and women’s styles and in light and dark colors:\n\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"https://cottonbureau.com/products/hypercritical\">Hypercritical t-shirt</a> - Gold, Gray, Pink, and White</li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://cottonbureau.com/products/hypercritical-dark\">Hypercritical t-shirt (Dark)</a> - Navy and Black</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My sincere thanks to everyone who has purchased a shirt, past and present, and to all the people who continue to read this website and listen to and <a href=\"/membership/\">support my podcasts</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>A lot has changed since my last Hypercritical t-shirt sale. Most notably, I <a href=\"/2022/03/30/independence-day\">went independent</a> in March of 2022, turning my former “side projects” into the sole source of my income.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past decade or so, advertising has made up the vast majority of my podcast income. The podcast ad market has taken a big downturn this year for shows like mine, which has been rough. Thankfully, <a href=\"/membership/\">podcast membership</a> has helped make up some of the difference.</p>\n\n<p>Merchandise sales like these also help—though less than you might think. Manufacturing and shipping physical products is expensive, and the costs are always increasing. But every little bit helps. And as a podcast fan myself, I understand the draw. A shocking amount of my daily wardrobe consists of podcast t-shirts from the shows I listen to.</p>\n\n<p>That’s really what these sales are about: fans want shirts, and I want to provide them. And, yes, each shirt sold does make me a few bucks, so the more I sell, the better. But there’s a reason I only do these sales once every five years. I want these shirts to be special.</p>\n\n<p>And when people’s shirts are starting to become threadbare five years from today, I’ll have another sale for those who want to buy replacements. Think of it as a <i>really</i> slow, non-renewing subscription plan for Hypercritical t-shirts. Just try not to spill anything on your shirts in the meantime. (Or consider <a href=\"https://cottonbureau.com/people/john-siracusa\">buying backups</a>! You know me and backups…)</p>",

If you can immediately picture the videos for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0aqLwHP4y6Q\">Hey Mickey</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nM4okRvCg2g\">The Safety Dance</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3dOx510kyOs\">You Might Think</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lAD6Obi7Cag\">Money For Nothing</a>, and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/djV11Xbc914\">Take On Me</a>, you might be too. I was transfixed from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV#Launch\">day one</a>, not just by the bands and the music, but by the format. Some videos <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NCZuYS-9qaw\">told a story</a> (of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lcOxhH8N3Bo\">varying levels of coherence</a>). Others were <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5IsSpAOD6K8\">more of</a> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XcATvu5f9vE\">a vibe</a>, as the kids say these days. But always, the combination of sound and images, intertwined, synchronizing and diverging, pressed all my buttons.</p>\n\n<p>My affection for an equal partnership between music and video is reflected in many of <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/siracusa/films/by/entry-rating/\">the movies I love</a>. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/goodfellas/\">Goodfellas</a>, one of my <a href=\"https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/642/\">all-time favorites</a>, is arguably structured as a series of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-NWEfWEdQY0?t=24\">music videos</a> separated by exposition. <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-empire-strikes-back/\">The best Star Wars movies</a> are famous for their <a href=\"https://youtu.be/c8deRYotdng?t=2m13s\">pervasive</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pfuZWP4YDW4\">dominating</a> scores.</p>\n\n<p>Even today, the alchemy of carefully combined music and video has not lost its power. Witness the outsized cultural impact of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bV0RAcuG2Ao?t=43\">a certain scene in Stranger Things season 4</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In all these cases, it’s not just the fact that there’s music in addition to dialog and sound effects. It’s that the music steps forward—both technically (in the audio mix) and emotionally. The music is a main character in much of the media that I love.</p>\n\n<p>When game consoles added the ability to easily record gameplay, I immediately knew what I wanted to do with that capability. I wanted to make music videos.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"enter-destiny\">Enter Destiny</h2>\n\n<p>I’ve been playing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_(video_game)\">Destiny</a> since shortly after it was released in 2014. For complicated and mostly business-related reasons, the game I’m playing today is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_2\">Destiny 2</a>, but it’s been a largely unbroken experience across the two games for the past eight years.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a huge amount of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/TrueVanguard\">Destiny-related</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/FalloutPlays\">video</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/DattoDoesDestiny\">content</a> on YouTube, and I’ve watched a lot of it. Two things are very clear about these kinds of videos. First, much like golf or tennis on TV, you’ll find it a lot more interesting if you’ve ever played the game yourself.  Second, also like televised sports, the people playing Destiny in these videos are usually <i>very</i> good at the game.</p>\n\n<p>I am not very good at Destiny. Even after literally thousands of hours<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> of playing, I am just about average. And although Destiny is a popular game with millions of players, the chances of someone seeing one of my videos <i>and also</i> being a Destiny player is quite small.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a formula for success. My lack of game-playing skill means I can’t produce the raw material (i.e., gameplay recordings) needed to make really great videos, and my existing audience of <a href=\"https://atp.fm\">Apple tech nerds</a> has only a small overlap with the world of Destiny.</p>\n\n<p>But did I let this stop me? I did not. Six years ago, I started with a few tentative uploads of some awful (even by my standards) gameplay with minimal editing, no commentary, and no music. (I also snuck in a gag video based on my realization that the movie <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/moana-2016/\">Moana</a> and the first season of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)\">Westworld</a> both have <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yhURIMj2hCI\">the same emotional climax</a>. It’s true!)</p>\n\n<p>My first Destiny music video shows me learning <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0txZ4l98byg\">how to not be <i>irredeemably</i> awful at using a sniper rifle</a> in Destiny. It’s a record of the moment when, after <i>four years</i> of playing the game, I finally understood how sniping is supposed to work. It shows me graduating from “truly awful” to “merely bad.” (This was back when a single sniper headshot wouldn’t kill a roaming super, whippersnappers!)</p>\n\n<p>Next came the “quest” videos, each of which cataloged my journey to acquire some in-game item (e.g., a <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/2019/7/3/18760070/pinnacle-weapons-all-exotic-list-weapons-guns-complete-list-season-update\">pinnacle weapon</a>). This is where I started to develop a recognizable style and format.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than retreating from the skill and audience problems described earlier, I embraced them. Since few people would ever see my videos, I could remain blissfuly unconcerned about <a href=\"https://youtu.be/S2xHZPH5Sng\">enticing titles and custom thumbnails</a>. As for the assumed knowledge necessary to get the most from these videos, I piled it on instead of trying to minimize it.</p>\n\n<p>Take my <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aXTDiBJV8XQ\">Revoker Quest</a> video as an example. To understand its premise, you’d have to know that “Revoker” is a sniper rifle and that the quest to obtain it requires a large number of sniper kills while playing against other people in Destiny.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, it would also help to know some things about <i>me</i>. You might know (perhaps from watching earlier videos) that I’m not very good at sniping in Destiny, and you might also know that my preferred weapon in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player\">PvP</a> is a shotgun (or at least you might know that shotguns are widely considered “easier to use” than sniper rifles). If you were playing Destiny when the Revoker quest was active, you might be familiar with how quest progress is presented in the user interface, and you might further know that the Revoker quest had multiple components, not all of which required sniper kills.</p>\n\n<p>You need <i>all of this context</i> to understand the orchestrated climax of the video (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/aXTDiBJV8XQ?t=5m12s\">starting at around 5:12</a>), in which I realize that I have completed the sniper-kills portion of the quest and can finally switch back to a <a href=\"https://destinyitemmanager.com/\">loadout</a> where I feel much more competent: a shotgun and a hand cannon. Oh, and that hand cannon? It’s Luna’s Howl, the arduous acquisition of which was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DFp53BDurjs\">documented in an earlier quest video</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXTDiBJV8XQ\" title=\"Revoker Quest\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>Similarly, only someone who is average (or worse) at Destiny and has suffered through the pain of having to get <i>200 double-kills</i> with a grenade launcher in PvP and <i>100 <a href=\"https://www.light.gg/db/legend/triumphs/3213956593/calculated-trajectory/\">Calculated Trajectory medals</a></i> in order to complete the (pre-nerf, dagnabbit!) Mountaintop quest can truly appreciate the pain and suffering documented in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6B7erxjssu8\">my video</a> about it. Fighting for heavy ammo to get “easy” kills with a heavy GL; getting one kill and then immediately dying; learning how to use <a href=\"https://www.light.gg/db/items/3549153978/fighting-lion/\">Fighting Lion</a>, a weapon I’d ignored until its ability to use primary ammo made it uniquely suited to this quest—it’s all in there.</p>\n\n<p>If this is all starting to sound like gibberish to you, I understand. It’s asking a lot of the audience to have so much background information and experience. The fact that I’m unable to communicate the prerequisite knowledge in the videos themselves is a condemnation of both my skills as an editor and as a game player. (I can only work with gameplay recordings that I generate myself, after all.)</p>\n\n<p>And yet…I love these videos. I love the idea that a handful of people might watch them with all the context required to fully appreciate them. I love watching them myself from time to time, if only to see my own progress as a player and an editor.</p>\n\n<p>I also love the moment during my normal life when inspiration strikes and I know what song I’m going to use for my next music video. Sometimes it’s months between the moment of inspiration and when I finally get around to making the video. This was the case with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1NfJo4SJfRE\">my most recent release</a>, but I’m glad I waited long enough for it to be my first video made with 60-fps gameplay from my PlayStation 5.</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NfJo4SJfRE\" title=\"Never Can Say Goodbye\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>It’s not a “quest” video (Bungie removed pinnacle weapons a few years ago), so the scant narrative scaffolding that used to exist is gone now. Instead, I’ve gone back to my roots. I’m just trying to make a good music video. Here’s hoping someone else out there enjoys them as much as I do.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If you don’t want to wade through everything on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/siracusa\">my channel</a>, here’s a list of my Destiny music videos in reverse-chronological order.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1NfJo4SJfRE\">Never Can Say Goodbye</a> – October 13, 2022</li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6B7erxjssu8\">The Mountaintop</a> – January 17, 2021</li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zjli91sides\">Randy’s Quest</a> – October 26, 2019</li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JIHl5wnbLSs\">Spinning Up</a> – September 6, 2019</li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aXTDiBJV8XQ\">Revoker Quest</a> – July 7, 2019</li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Vzy7uQiO0Fo\">Redrix Quest</a> – April 19, 2019</li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DFp53BDurjs\">Luna Quest</a> – March 3, 2019</li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0txZ4l98byg\">Snipe’s Awakening</a> – November 8, 2018</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\"><p><a href=\"https://chrisfried.github.io/secret-scrublandeux/\">4,124 hours</a> as of February 5, 2023. <a href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"return to article\">↩</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

It’s a free update for existing SwitchGlass users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"app-store-badge\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/switchglass/id1498546559?ls=1&amp;mt=12\"><img src=\"/images/download-on-mac-app-store.svg\" height=\"40\" alt=\"Download SwitchGlass on the Mac App Store\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Since the <a href=\"/2020/02/12/switchglass\">initial release of SwitchGlass in 2020</a>, the top feature request has been the ability to manually reorder apps in the app switcher. Version 2.0 adds that feature, and <a href=\"/switchglass/#2.0\">many more</a>. To learn more about SwitchGlass, <a href=\"/switchglass/#faq\">read the FAQ</a> and the <a href=\"/2020/02/12/switchglass\">introductory post from 2020</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Though SwitchGlass 2.0 does not appear very different on the outside, more than 50% of the code has changed since the last 1.x release in April, 2022. The view that runs the app switcher saw the most significant revisions, thanks to my graduation from “absolute beginner” to “novice” when it comes to writing <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui\">SwiftUI</a> code. Baby steps.</p>\n\n<p>I had to bump up the <a href=\"/switchglass/#os-support\">minimum supported OS</a> to macOS 12.0 Monterey in order to implement drag-and-drop reordering in the app switcher. This is the price of using a framework like SwiftUI that’s still in its infancy on the Mac, I suppose. I would love to continue to update and support the 1.x version that runs on macOS 10.15 Catalina and later, but the Mac App Store does not allow it. Customers who purchased an earlier version of SwitchGlass can still use and re-download that version on pre-Monterey systems, but I can’t publish any new 1.x releases to the Mac App Store.</p>\n\n<p>I started using <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664\">TestFlight for macOS</a> to distribute early versions of SwitchGlass 2.0 to a small group of beta testers. Thanks to everyone who provided bug reports and feature suggestions. If you’re interested in testing prerelease versions of SwitchGlass, <a href=\"mailto:switchglass@hypercritical.co?subject=SwitchGlass TestFlight membership\">let me know</a>. There are <a href=\"https://www.truetex.com/knuthchk.htm\">always</a> more bugs to be found…</p>",

      "content": "<audio id=\"the-time-given-audio\" src=\"/2022/03/30/sounds/the-time-given.mp3\"></audio>\n\n<p>When I graduated college in 1997, I started a full-time job with the same dot-com startup that I had been working for part time during my senior year. In the twenty-five years that have followed, I’ve had a series of jobs in the same field (\"full-stack web development,\" in today’s parlance).</p>\n\n<p>I’ve worked for companies of all sizes, from tiny startups to enterprise businesses with billions of dollars and thousands of employees. I’ve worked in downtown Boston, in Cambridge, and in the western suburbs. I’ve commuted to work by train, by car, and not at all. (I worked remotely at my very first job, and I have done so on and off for many years since.)  All these jobs have been in the typical nine-to-five mold, and I’ve usually gone from one to the next without even a single day off in between.</p>\n\n<p>Ever since my first job, I’ve also always done…something else—something besides my “day job,” something that at least had the <i>potential</i> to bring in some extra money. I did a little contract programming at the start, but I didn’t find it appealing to just do more of what I was already doing.\n\n<p>I started <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/author/john-siracusa/\">writing for Ars Technica</a> in 1999, and I continued doing that <a href=\"/2015/04/15/os-x-reviewed\">for fifteen years</a>. I also wrote for Macworld (for print and the web), for my own website, and for a few other small publications. I enjoyed writing, and I could get paid for it.</p>\n\n<p>Eleven years ago, as my writing tapered off, I started <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/about/appearances/#podcasts\">podcasting</a>, which I also enjoyed and found I could get paid for. Two years ago, I wrote <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/apps/\">two small Mac apps</a> to scratch a few of my own itches.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, outside of my work life, I got married, bought a house, and had two children. Over the years, I’ve had to learn how to balance these competing concerns. As the financial demands of my life have increased, I’ve had to find a way to increase my income. As my family responsibilities have grown, I’ve had to reduce my “extra” work to a manageable level.</p>\n\n<p>As part of this process, I’ve had to find what I think of as my “maximum capacity.” How much can I ask of myself before I fall apart? I learned some important lessons at my very first job, even before I had a house or kids, by slamming hard into the limits of my own body thanks to <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wJI2ZN\">chronic RSI</a>. Later, my children helped me plumb the depths of sleep deprivation while also entirely recalibrating my value system.</p>\n\n<p>At each decision point, I’ve adjusted my life to fit within my maximum capacity by curtailing “unnecessary” activities. My family and my day job were necessities. Everything else was optional. As I’ve gotten older, my maximum capacity has decreased, of course, and I have exceeded my limits on many occasions. But for the most part, I’ve been able to keep it together.</p>\n\n<p>It hasn’t always felt great to be running “at maximum capacity” (or slightly beyond) for two and a half decades, but it has always felt like the right thing to do during this critical part of my life.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sprint-dawning\">Spring Dawning</h2>\n\n<p>Over the past few years, something has started to change. When I’ve been presented with interesting opportunities that I’ve had to turn down (“Sorry, I’m at my maximum capacity right now…”) it has started to feel less like disciplined life-management and more like disappointment. It’s felt similarly lousy when I’ve had to reject my own ideas for new things I’d like to try. And when I’ve ignored those feelings and said yes when I knew I should say no (e.g., when I decided to make <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/apps/\">two Mac apps</a> in two months), I’ve quickly bumped into my limits yet again—both physical and mental.</p>\n\n<p>A few years ago, I started to question some of my assumptions. My decades of work on my “second career” had slowly built it up to the point where it was plausibly viable on its own. Was my day job <i>really</i> necessary? I started formulating a plan to quit.</p>\n\n<p>Then came COVID-19…and it kept coming. There was just too much uncertainty. My plans were put on hold. It’s been a rough few years for everyone, including my family. The whole experience recalibrated my value system one more time. I started to think more about the limited number of years I have left—with my kids, in good health, on this earth. <a href=\"/2022/03/30/sounds/the-time-given.mp3\" onclick=\"playAudio('the-time-given-audio'); return false;\">How</a> do I want to spend that time?</p>\n\n<p>By 2022, I had returned to thinking not only that it’s possible for me to quit my day job, but that it’s <i>necessary</i> for me to do so.</p>\n\n<p>And so, on March 25, 2022, I left my “normal” job. I am now officially self-employed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"on-my-own\">On My Own</h2>\n\n<p>“Going indie” is what we used to call it in the early 2000s. Back then, in my circles, it usually meant creating and selling your own Mac (and, eventually, iPhone) apps, but each person’s road to independence is different.</p>\n\n<p>I’m lucky to know so many people who have walked this same path before me. They’ve all taught me so much about what it means—and what it takes—to be independent. John Gruber <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2006/04/initiative\">took some huge risks</a> when he went independent back in 2006. At that time, like John, I had recently had my first child, and the idea of quitting my “real job” was unthinkable to me. All my <a href=\"/about/appearances/#podcasts\">current podcast</a> co-hosts are independent: <a href=\"http://www.merlinmann.com\">Merlin Mann</a> since 2002, <a href=\"https://marco.org/2010/09/21/job-transition\">Marco Arment since 2010</a>, <a href=\"https://www.caseyliss.com/2018/6/1/taking-risks\">Casey Liss since 2018</a>, and <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2014/09/september-10-2014-a-personal-announcement/\">Jason Snell since 2014</a>. And there are many more—too many to list here. When I think about the friends I’ve made as part of my second career, it often seems like they’re <i>all</i> independent. Now, finally, I’m ready.</p>\n\n<p>I am thankful to have had such a conventional, largely successful career at my various day jobs. Like many people who entered the tech world in the late 1990s, I worked for several companies that were later acquired or went out of business. And, like most people, I did not strike it rich at any point via an IPO or similar “exit” event. But the regular salary from my day job did help pay for my house, my car, some nice vacations—a whole life for myself and my family, which is all I ever wanted.</p>\n\n<p>I’m also thankful for everyone who has made my second career possible: all the people who have read my writing or listened to me on a podcast. Special thanks to those of you who have supported me by buying something from a sponsor or paying me directly for my work. I would not be able to do this without you.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I want to thank my wife, Tina, who has always supported my “weird hobbies,” even back when they took an amount of my time that was far out of proportion with the money they brought in. Each time I have exceeded my maximum capacity over the years, she has been there to pick up the slack, all while pursuing her own career. I would not be where I am today without her love and support.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>You can hear me talk more about this topic on <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/rd/179\">episode 179 of Reconcilable Differences</a> (starting at <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+E5IM4zUTs/50:47\">50:47</a>).</p>\n\n<p id=\"membership\">If you want to know how you can best support my work, the answer right now is through podcast memberships. It’s not a coincidence that so many independent podcasts started paid membership programs shortly after COVID hit. Memberships provide reliable income in an uncertain market. Each of my podcasts has a membership program, linked below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"https://atp.fm/join\">Accidental Tech Podcast</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://relay.fm/rd/join\">Reconcilable Differences</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.theincomparable.com/members/\">Robot or Not</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both monthly and annual memberships are available. The member benefits vary, but all include a version of the show without any ads, plus some amount of bonus content.</p>\n\n<p>Podcasts are now literally how I make my living. (Boy, that’s weird to write. I’m not sure how I’m going to say it to people in person.) I hope you’ll all continue to listen. Wish me luck…</p>",

      "content": "<div type=\"xhtml\"><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>My  has garnered a lot of feedback. I’m sure streaming app developers already gather feedback from their users, and I’m also sure that the tone of my post has skewed the nature of the feedback I received. Nevertheless, for posterity, here’s how people are feeling about the streaming video apps they use.<a href=\"/2022/02/15/streaming-apps\">unsolicited streaming app spec</a></p><p>The number one complaint, by far, was that streaming apps make it too difficult to resume watching whatever you were already watching. As I , conflicting incentives easily explain this, but people still hate it. A reader who wished to remain anonymous sent this story of how customer satisfaction gets sacrificed on the altar of “engagement.”<a href=\"/2022/02/15/streaming-apps#/2022/02/15/streaming-apps\">noted earlier</a></p><p>This is definitely a case of “.” I don’t doubt that whatever metric is being used to gauge “engagement” is indeed boosted by burying the “Continue Watching” section, but I must emphasize again, according to the feedback I received, people  this practice with a fiery passion. It makes them dislike the app, and sometimes also the streaming service itself.<a href=\"https://management.curiouscatblog.net/2007/05/09/be-careful-what-you-measure/\">be careful what you measure</a><i>hate</i></p><p>I don’t think any engagement-related metric is worth angering users in this way—even if it really  help users discover new content or stay subscribed longer. I’m reminded of , “People won’t remember what you said, but they will remember how you made them feel.” It applies to apps as well as people.<i>does</i><a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/04/06/they-feel/\">the old saying</a></p><p>(Furthermore, given the fact that seemingly every popular streaming app does this to some degree, there’s an opportunity to seize a competitive advantage by becoming the first app to stop this user-hostile practice.)</p><p>The second biggest category of feedback was about detecting, preserving, and altering state. Apps that do a poor job of deciding when something has been “watched” drew much ire. (Hint: most people don’t sit through all the ending credits.) Compounding this is the inability to manually mark something as watched or unwatched. Failure to reliably sync state across devices is the cherry on top.</p><p>People don’t feel like they are in control of their “data,” such as it is. The apps make bad guesses or forget things they should remember, and the user has no way to correct them. Some people told me they have simply given up. They now treat their streaming app as a glorified search box, hunting anew each time for the content they want to watch, and keeping track of what they’ve already watched using other means, sometimes even using other apps. (I imagine this flailing on each app launch may read as “increased engagement.”)</p><p>Finally, there was a long tail of basic usability complaints: text that’s too small; text that’s truncated, with no way to see more; non-obvious navigation; inscrutable icons and controls; and a general lack of preferences or settings, leaving everyone at the mercy of the defaults. Oh yeah, and don’t forget bugs, of course. Multiple people cited my personal most-hated bug: pausing and then resuming playback only to have it start playing from a position several minutes in the past. Have fun trying to fast-forward to where you  left off without accidentally spoiling anything for yourself by over-shooting!<i>actually</i></p><p>While again acknowledging how the nature of my  (and my audience in general) surely affects the feedback I receive, I think it’s worth noting that —not a single person—wrote to tell me how much they loved using their streaming app. I didn’t expect to get much pushback on a post criticizing something so widely maligned, but I did expect to get . I’m sure many people do enjoy their streaming app of choice, especially if it’s one of the more obscure, tech-oriented ones like  or , but the overall sentiment is clear. Do streaming services care? I think they should.<a href=\"/2022/02/15/streaming-apps\">original post</a><a href=\"https://www.plex.tv/\">Plex</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/getchannels/status/1493663711797596166\">Channels</a><i>no one</i><i>some</i></p><blockquote><p>There was an experiment at Hulu last year to move “Continue Watching” below the fold (down 2 rows from where it was). This was done with a very small group of users. It was so successful that the increased engagement was projected to generate more than $20 million a year. The experiment was immediately ended and the new position was deployed to all users.</p><p>While I understand (and largely agree with) your frustration that your “in progress” show isn’t the top feature, you can argue that [making new content more prominent] provides the user more value as they discover content they wouldn’t have otherwise (hence the increased engagement).</p></blockquote></div></div>",

      "content": "<p>I subscribe to a lot of streaming video services, and that means I use a lot of streaming video apps. Most of them fall short of my expectations. Here, then, is a simple specification for a streaming video app. Follow it, and your app will be well on its way to <a href=\"https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">not sucking</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This spec includes only the basics. It leaves plenty of room for apps to differentiate themselves by surprising and delighting their users with clever features not listed here. But to all the streaming app developers out there, please consider covering these fundamentals before working on your <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_selling_proposition\">Unique Selling Proposition</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, a list of even the most rudimentary features can’t help but also be opinionated. Though my tastes have surely influenced this list, I really do think that any streaming app that fails to implement nearly all of these features is failing its users. Again, these are not frills. These are the <a href=\"https://www.barebones.com\" class=\"stealth\">bare-bones</a> basics.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"launch-experience\">Launch Experience</h2>\n\n<p><b>On launch, it must be immediately obvious how to resume watching whatever the user was watching previously.</b> This may be the most important feature outside <a href=\"#video-player\">the video player itself</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If the user was in the middle of watching an episode of a TV show, the most prominent thing on the screen should be a way to continue that episode. If the user just finished an episode, then “resuming” means watching the next episode, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Resuming <i>exactly</i> where the user left off—for example, launching into the video player, paused at the exact moment the user stopped watching—is also acceptable, <i>provided</i> it is made obvious that this has happened. Launching into a completely black video playback screen is not a good experience.</p>\n\n<p>(I am ignoring user profiles for now—that’s how basic this specification is. But a good app should support profiles in some way, and this may add a step for the user to select their profile before getting to the point where they can resume viewing.)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"information-architecture\">Information Architecture</h2>\n\n<p><b>Expose and support the intrinsic information hierarchy of the media.</b> TV shows have seasons. Seasons have episodes. Episodes are made by people (actors, writers, directors). Whatever other ways an app chooses to slice and dice the media it vends, it must also support the simple hierarchy that is most likely to match the user’s mental model.</p>\n\n<p>This hierarchy should exist both visually and navigationally. From an episode of a TV show, it should be obvious how to go up in the hierarchy to the season that the episode exists within, and from there to the list of seasons in the show, and then perhaps down into another season, then down into an episode of that season, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Though it’s often desirable to take shortcuts when navigating (e.g., to jump back to the home screen after completing the final episode of a TV series), that doesn’t mean the hierarchy shouldn’t exist at all. A shortcut is a way to skip levels in the hierarchy, not a way to erase it from the app entirely.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"state-preservation\">State Preservation</h2>\n\n<p><b>Keep track of what the user has done, and when.</b> Which things has the user watched? Were they watched entirely or partially? How many times has something been watched? Were any parts skipped? This information is crucial for the functionality of the app, and it should be treated as precious. Preserve this state the same way a text editor preserves typed characters. Sync it across all instances of the app.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visual-communication\">Visual Communication</h2>\n\n<p><b>The things the app knows should be communicated visually to the user.</b> When viewing a list of episodes, put something on the screen to indicate which ones have been viewed and which ones haven’t. Consider showing a user’s progress within an episode as well. No one likes visual clutter, but a simple progress bar (for example) can show both of these things in a single, slim interface element.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, when video is playing, it should be possible to find out what, exactly, is being played. The most straightforward way to do this is to show some text when the video is paused that identifies the TV show, season number, and episode number.</p>\n\n<p>The user has questions, and the app has the answers. It need only communicate them. What am I watching? How long is it? How much time is left? What is the name of this actor? What year was this movie made? When will the next episode of this TV show be released? Was this TV show cancelled? And on and on. This information is useless if it’s not exposed in the interface. Visual elements—well-placed in a sensible <a href=\"#information-architecture\">information hierarchy</a>—are the key to solving this problem.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"video-player\">Video Player</h2>\n\n<p><b>The following playback controls must be <i>one</i> tap/click away</b> and must have large, obvious targets</b>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> <b>Play/pause</b>. Ideally, a single control that toggles between functions.</li>\n<li> <b>Skip forward/backward by some small number of seconds</b>.</li>\n<li> <b>Enable/disable subtitles</b>. Note that this is separate from selecting <i>which</i> subtitles you want to see. This is just to turn them on and off.</li>\n<li> <b>Skip to the beginning or the end of the video</b>.</li>\n<li> <b>Some way to stop watching</b>. This can be a “close” control (e.g., an “X” button) or a way to navigate “back” or similar.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>The following playback controls must be accessible without leaving the video player</b>. They may be more than one tap/click away.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> <b>Select audio track</b>.</li>\n<li> <b>Select subtitle track</b> or disable subtitles.</b></li>\n<li> <b>Skip forward/backward to some arbitrary position.</b> This is most often accomplished with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrubbing_(audio)\">scrubber</a> on a video timeline.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>The following information must be accessible without leaving the video player</b>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> <b>The title of the video, including its hierarchical context</b>. For example, the TV show, season number, and episode number.</li>\n<li> <b>The duration of the video and the current playback position within it</b>.</li>\n<li> <b>The time remaining in the current video</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>There must be a way to pause the video and get an <i>unobstructed</i> view of a still frame.</b> That means no playback controls on top of the video and no dimming or tinting of the video frame. It’s fine if it takes a few taps to get to this state, but it must be possible.</p>\n\n<p><b>When a video ends, there must be a way to go to the next video</b>, assuming there is an obvious choice for this (e.g., the next episode in a TV show).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"my-list\">My List</h2>\n\n<p><b>There must be a way for the user to manually create a list of media.</b> In the common case, this is a list of media that the user intends to watch (eventually), but it can be used for any purpose. The important part is that the user makes the list intentionally. Nothing gets added to this list automatically.</p>\n\n<p>At a minimum, the list must accept top-level items in the hierarchy (e.g., TV shows, movies). The list could also accept more granular items, like individual TV episodes.</p>\n\n<p>This is the one feature that may seem the least “basic,” but it really is essential. There’s so much good content available today that we need our apps to help us keep track of it all, not just what we’re currently watching. If state preservation and visual communication are the app’s short-term memory, then “My List” is the app’s long-term memory.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2 id=\"low-bar\">A Low Bar</h2>\n\n<p>This is a pretty boring list, huh? A streaming app with <i>only</i> these features seems like it would be quite limited. But the sad fact is that few, if any, popular streaming apps reach even this extremely low bar. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"netflix\">Netflix <small style=\"font-weight: normal\">(iOS)</small></h3>\n\n<p>The last thing I did in the app was watch part of an episode of a TV show. On launch, after selecting my user profile, the show I was in the middle of watching is not visible anywhere on the screen. The “Continue watching for John” section, several screens lower down, contains buttons to resume many other shows, but not the one I was just watching. (Maybe it’s because I started watching it from “My List”? Who knows?)</p>\n\n<p>When playing video, there is no way to toggle subtitles on and off with a single tap. (It takes three taps to turn them on and another three to turn them off.) There is also no way to skip to the beginning other than dragging the scrubber manually.</p>\n\n<p>Pausing the video shows the season number, episode number, and title, but not the name of the TV show.</p>\n\n<p>The duration of the video is not shown anywhere unless the video has just started. To get the duration, the user must add the time remaining (displayed at the end of the timeline) to the current play position (displayed when the scrubber is “grabbed” by holding a finger down on it).</p>\n\n<p>Though there is limited access to the intrinsic hierarchy of the media (e.g., I can go from watching an episode of a TV show to a list of episodes in the current season), it is incomplete, and it does not expose all the available information. For example, there is no obvious way to get from the video player to the episode list and then to  a detail screen for an individual episode that shows things like the cast and the date it was released. Instead, the video must be “closed,” which <i>may</i> lead to an episode detail page, provided that’s where you started when navigating to the episode in the first place. The information hierarchy, such as it exists, is quite a muddle, and it only sporadically intersects with the navigation hierarchy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hbo-max\">HBO Max <small style=\"font-weight: normal\">(iPadOS)</small></h3>\n\n<p>The last thing I did in the app was watch the latest episode of a TV show. On launch, a promo for a show I have never watched fills most of the screen, and a small “Continue Watching” section is partially visible at the very bottom. It shows an episode of a TV show that I have already finished watching (complete with an entirely full progress bar) and a movie I skipped into the middle of to check something several months ago. The TV show I was watching is not listed, even though the only thing I’ve done in the HBO Max app for the past week is watch episodes of this show.</p>\n\n<p>When playing video, there is no way to toggle subtitles on and off with a single tap. (It takes three taps to turn them on and another three to turn them off.)</p>\n\n<p>The duration of the video is not shown anywhere unless the video has just started. To get the duration, the user must add the time remaining (displayed at the end of the timeline) to the current play position (displayed at the start of the timeline).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"disney-plus\">Disney+ <small style=\"font-weight: normal\">(Apple TV)</small></h3>\n\n<p>The last thing I did in the app was watch part of an episode of a TV show. On launch, after selecting my user profile, the show I was in the middle of watching is not visible anywhere on the screen. I had to scroll down two rows to get to the “Continue Watching” section, where my episode was listed.</p>\n\n<p>When playing video, there is no way to toggle subtitles on and off with a single action. Instead, I have to swipe down to display a menu of options, swipe over to subtitles, swipe down to pick a language, and click to select it—then do the same steps again to turn subtitles off.</p>\n\n<p>I could not find a way to get from the video player to either an episode list or a detail page for the episode I’m watching. Like the Netflix app (and many others), the relationship between the information hierarchy and the navigation hierarchy is tenuous at best.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>This is not an exhaustive exploration of any of these apps, let alone all streaming apps. And I’m sure some people will quibble with the particulars of my spec. For example, why place so much emphasis on quick access to subtitles? (It’s because being able to quickly skip backwards and briefly enable subtitles is something I do frequently, both on my own and at the request of others. Though keeping subtitles on all the time is surely the most common use case, briefly enabling them to clarify a few lines of dialogue is a close second.)</p>\n\n<p>And, yes, I know that there are often other, “better” ways to accomplish these tasks in some apps on some platforms. For example, I can hold down the microphone button on my Apple TV remote and say “enable subtitles” or “disable subtitles” and it will usually work. Better still, I can ask “What did he say?” and the Apple TV will skip backwards, enable subtitles, play for a short duration, and then disable subtitles again, all on its own. Surprise and delight!</p>\n\n<p>But none of this changes the overall picture, which is that even the most popular, well-funded streaming video apps fail to get the <i>basics</i> right in a shocking number of ways. <a id=\"conflicting-incentives\"></a>Conflicting incentives surely explain some of these failings (e.g., promoting new content rather than letting me quickly resume what I was already watching), but an explanation doesn’t make these shortcomings any less bothersome.</p>\n\n<p>And then there are the gaps that seem unmotivated. Is there really no room on a giant iPad or TV screen to show me the name of the TV show I’m watching when the video is paused? Why is it so hard to go from viewing an episode of a TV show to a list of episodes for that show? Why is there sometimes no way <i>other</i> than voice control to enable subtitles or change the audio track while watching a video? There’s plenty of low-hanging fruit waiting to be picked.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"good-to-great\">From Good to Great</h2>\n\n<p>I tried to limit myself to the basics to prove a point, but there is a vast world of good ideas that are <i>just</i> beyond the basics. These are simple, proven techniques like remembering which option a user picked from a menu the last time and bubbling that up as the top choice, or adding (gasp!) settings to let the user configure features according to their preferences, like how many seconds forward or backwards the skip buttons should travel, or which subtitle or audio track should be on by default, perhaps with per-show customizations.</p>\n\n<p>And if you think this spec is just a list of my personal preferences, I can assure you that list is <i>much</i> longer. To give just one example, I wish every streaming app had a way to advance forward and backward by a single frame at a time. Trying to precisely manipulate the play/pause button or the timeline scrubber to get to the exact frame where I can read some bit of background text is not a game I enjoy playing. (Laggy, unresponsive apps make this even worse.)</p>\n\n<p>Also consider creating interface elements that are reusable. A good control for filtering and sorting lists, for example, could be used in many places within a streaming app. (Most offer no sorting options at all, which is criminal.) The same goes for iconography for status and actions: standardize it, and use it everywhere. It’s a sad state of affairs when the original <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiVo\">TiVo</a> on-screen interface bests most modern streaming apps in terms of predictability, legibility, and consistency.</p>\n\n<p>And let’s not forget the tried-and-true practice of stealing features from competitors. How has no one yet copied <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/adlp/xray\">Amazon’s X-Ray feature</a>? Why doesn’t Apple TV+ have any way to manually curate a list of TV shows like seemingly every one of its competitors? Why don’t more apps provide multiple organizational views of the same content like the Disney+ app does? (E.g., release order vs. chronological order for movie series.)</p>\n\n<p>Most streaming apps aim for mass-market appeal, so they can’t get too complex. But today, they’re at the far opposite end of the spectrum, missing basic functionality rather than being bogged down with fancy features and customization. These apps need to walk before they can run. I hope, someday, at least one or two of them can fly.</p>",

I purchased and returned several waffle makers that were just terrible. I could not find a reasonably priced model that was competent and consistent. I finally bit the bullet and bought the Breville.

It’s a point I’ve already tried to make on <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+R7DX6gwC4/1:34:43\">a recent episode of ATP</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/1273751956608167936\">on Twitter</a>. Before WWDC arrives with its own wave of Apple-related news, I’d like to take one more run at it. Here goes.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone wants apps that are feature-rich, easy-to-use, secure, and have good customer support. Apple, developers, and customers all agree on this. Incentives diverge slightly from here. Both Apple and developers want to make money. Customers want app prices to be low, but also want apps that are well-supported and maintained.</p>\n\n<p>Apple, through its control of the App Store, dictates the terms that developers must agree to in order to distribute iOS apps to customers. Apple’s rules determine how the interests of all parties are balanced.</p>\n\n<p>For many years now, Apple has been aiming for an ambitious goal state: an App Store filled with feature-rich, easy-to-use, secure apps, sold at prices customers find attractive, and monetized in a way that keeps developers happy and profitable while also giving Apple a significant percentage of all app-related revenue: 30% for most things, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions/\">15% after the first year of subscriptions</a>, and some other, usually non-public number that’s less than 30% if you happen to be a fellow tech giant like Netflix or Amazon.</p>\n\n<p>The App Store rules are the most powerful tool Apple can use to achieve its goal. To this end, the rules have been adjusted many times over the years. But throughout all these changes, Apple has never given up on its dream of an App Store filled with great apps that make everyone happy and make lots of money for both Apple and developers.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Apple’s stance seems to be that if they just hold the line on a few key provisions of the App Store rules, companies will build their business models around Apple’s revenue cut in the same way companies built their business models around the costs of brick-and-mortar retail in the pre-Internet days. Apple seems to firmly believe that its ambitious goal state can be achieved with something close to the current set of App Store rules.</p>\n\n<p>This belief is not supported by the evidence. Years of history has shown that Apple is getting further away from its goal, not closer. Witness <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/31/netflix-stops-paying-the-apple-tax-on-its-853m-in-annual-ios-revenue/\">Netflix abandoning in-app purchase</a>, Apple having to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change\">strike a special deal with Amazon</a>, and <a href=\"https://youdownloadtheappanditdoesntwork.com/\">all the apps</a> skirting the existing rules as best they can, to the detriment of the user experience and both Apple’s and developers’ revenue. And this is before even considering <a href=\"https://hey.com/apple/iap/\">the customer support situation</a>, which has always been dire, or the existence of businesses like ebook sales that will never have an extra 30% handy to give to Apple.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s App Store rules need to change not (just) because developers don’t like them. They need to change because time and experience have shown that there is <i>no viable path to Apple’s goal state given the existing rules</i>. The details of <a href=\"https://hey.com/apple/\">any</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@vojto/app-store-rejected-my-simple-appfigures-client-5948136c6f0\">particular</a> <a href=\"https://support.hogbaysoftware.com/t/scripters-what-is-the-standard-way-to-run-scripts-from-within-an-app/4120\">App</a> <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/09/27/unfortunate-app-store-rejections/\">Store</a> <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/01/12/overcast-rejected-for-listing-competing-podcast-apps/\">controversy</a> can often distract from this larger reality. A hardline stance will not sway hearts and minds, and it has proven unable to change developers’ business models without sacrificing the user experience. Apple needs to decide if it wants to be “right,” or if it wants to be happy.<p>",

      "content": "<div type=\"xhtml\"><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>For a few years now, I’ve tracked the TV shows I’m watching using the iOS app , which integrates with the  service. Sadly, Couchy  last year. I’ve kept using it since then, but in the past few weeks it’s finally started to fail.<a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tracking-tv-shows-with-couchy/\">Couchy</a><a href=\"https://trakt.tv/\">Trakt.tv</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/couchyapp/status/1044245909670957057\">ceased development</a></p><p>I looked at (and purchased) many, many alternative apps back when Couchy’s demise was announced, but I could never find one that I liked as much. In particular, I haven’t found a match for the information density of Couchy’s main screen combined with its “smart” sort order.</p><p>Couchy’s main screen shows a scrollable grid of portrait-orientation poster images for each TV show, three to a row on my iPhone, each with text below it showing the show name, how many episodes behind I am, the season, the episode number, and title of the next episode. (I’d include a screenshot here, but poster images are no longer loading for me in Couchy, so it wouldn’t be much to look at.)</p><p>The sort order determines how the shows are placed in the grid. Within the app, Couchy describes its smart sort as follows:</p><p>As I’ve tweeted about my search for a Couchy-replacement app, I’ve found it difficult to explain what I’m looking for in terms of sorting. And even Couchy’s sorting is sometimes not quite what I want. So I’d like to explain here instead, free from Twitter’s character limits.</p><p>I use an app like Couchy because I’m usually in the middle of watching many different TV shows. When I have some time to watch TV, I launch Couchy to remind myself what I’m currently watching, how far behind I am, and which shows have new episodes waiting for me. This is my most important use case: .<i>choosing a show to watch</i></p><p>I have so many TV shows in my trakt.tv collection that sorting is essential to helping me select a show. I don’t want to scroll through dozens of shows to make a selection. I want to look at the top one or two screenfuls of shows on my phone and be sure that I’m seeing all the shows I’m most interested in watching now.</p><p>Most simple sort orders don’t work for my purposes. For example, consider sorting by the date of the latest episode. There are many shows in my collection that I’m not actively watching. Maybe I’ll get to them in the future, but for now, the unwatched episodes are just piling up. If those shows jump to the top of the sort order every time a new episode is released, it’s just noise to me. They’re obscuring the shows I actually want to watch.</p><p>Sorting by the number of unwatched episodes has similar problems. Sorting by the date I last watched an episode of a show might seem like it’d work, but I might really want to know about a newly released episode of a show that I’m caught up on but that hasn’t released an episode in a while.</p><p>If I had an actual, concrete algorithm in mind, I wouldn’t be writing all this. I could have explained it in a tweet. But I haven’t thought it through enough to nail it down at that level. What I can do instead is describe the desirable features of such an algorithm.</p><p>I could go on, but I think I’m getting into the weeds. The four points above capture most of it. I’m sure other people have their own preferred sorting orders, but this one is mine. I’ve seriously considered writing a trakt.tv client app for iOS just to scratch my own itch, but I don’t think I’m ready to tackle a task that large quite yet.</p><p>In the meantime, if you’re an author of one of the many trakt.tv client apps in the App Store, please consider implementing something like what I’ve described here. I’ve probably already purchased your app, but I’ll be extremely grateful on top of that.</p><blockquote><p>Shows will be sorted in the following order:</p><ul><li> Episodes airing today</li><li> Missing episodes</li><li> Awaiting episode</li><li> Ended shows</li></ul></blockquote><h2 id=\"what-i-want\">What I Want</h2><ul><li><p>If I’m not actively watching a show, it should be pushed down in the list. Deciding what “actively watching” means will surely involve some thresholds (e.g., “has watched an episode in the last N days”), and it would be nice if those were configurable.</p></li><li><p>Shows that I’m actively watching should jump to the front of the list when a new episode is released.</p></li><li><p>Shows that I really like but that are on a break (e.g., between seasons) should jump to the front of the list when a new episode or season is released. Again, determining which shows I “really like” is tricky. An easy out here is to just have me choose by marking them as favorites. A ranked list of favorites would be even better and would help with sorting decisions near the top of the list.</p></li><li><p>When sorting shows that I’m actively watching (or really like) that just had a new episode or season released, favor shows with the smallest backlog—except in cases where a whole new season just dropped for a favorite show. For example, let’s say I’m one episode behind on Homeland, two episodes behind on Fargo, and caught up on The Expanse, which is a favorite show. If Homeland and Fargo both release new episodes and The Expanse releases a whole new season, all on the same day, the sort order should be: The Expanse first (even though it has the largest backlog), Homeland second (because it has a shorter backlog than Fargo), and Fargo next.</p></li></ul></div></div>",

These were seventeen <i>formative</i> years for me, from the ages of 9 to 26. The user interface of classic Mac OS was as ingrained in me as Star Wars or any other cultural institution.</p>\n\n<p>My love for classic Mac OS is why I started researching and <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/2015/04/15/os-x-reviewed\">reviewing</a> Mac OS X. Big changes were coming to the Mac, and I was going to feel them more than most. I needed to know what I was in for.</p>\n\n<p>To deal with some of the changes in Mac OS X, I ran apps and system extensions that restored some behaviors from classic Mac OS. Over the years, I weaned myself off most of these, but a few stuck. In particular, I found I did not want to live without the window layering policy from classic Mac OS.</p>\n\n<p>In classic, when you click on a window that belongs to an application that’s not currently active, <i>all</i> the windows that belong to that application come to the front. In Mac OS X (and macOS), only the window that you click comes to the front.</p>\n\n<p>My <a href=\"https://atp.fm/episodes/96\">particular style of window management</a> leans heavily on the classic behavior. I also appreciate the Mac OS X behavior in certain circumstances, so I was delighted to find apps that enable both behaviors, using Shift-click to override the default.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, macOS Catalina’s lack of support for 32-bit apps finally killed <a href=\"https://dragthing.com\">the last of the apps</a> that implemented this feature. I was alone in a cold, barren world where I had to click on a Dock icon to switch to an app and bring all its windows to the front.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to get used to it, but I could not. Next, I tried to persuade a few of my developer friends to create a tiny Mac app that implements just this one feature. My friend <a href=\"https://leefyock.tumblr.com/post/190150350036/front-and-center\">Lee</a>, a longtime Mac developer and user, eventually took up the challenge and created a simple app to do it.</p>\n\n<p>It was missing a few features I wanted (the Shift-click override, the ability to hide the Dock icon, a menu bar icon, etc.), but Lee shared the source code with me and I dove in and tried to help. I added the Shift-click feature and a mode-switch preference. I drew an app icon and a menu bar icon. The app was just about done. It even had a name: <a href=\"/front-and-center/\">Front and Center</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The app was written in Objective-C. I’d <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/10/os-x-10-10/21/#swift\">always wanted</a> to do a real project in Swift, so I started a new project in Xcode and rewrote the entire (tiny) app in Swift. I’ve also always wanted to get some experience with the App Store, so Lee and I agreed that I would release it under my developer account (though we are sharing the profits).</p>\n\n<p>Front and Center is a trivial app—so trivial that I was afraid it would be rejected for its limited functionality. But when running, it is used literally hundreds of times a day. And I obviously found it so essential that I was willing to help bring it into existence myself. I also wanted to get some experience with the financial side of the App Store.</p>\n\n<p>All of this contributed to the decision to make Front and Center a (cheap) paid app. It’s <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/front-and-center/id1493996622?ls=1&amp;mt=12\">$4.99 on the Mac App Store</a>. I don’t expect to make any significant money from sales, but I’ve already gained a huge amount of experience just going through the process of development and distribution.</p>\n\n<p>I also view the price as a kind of deterrent. The increase in downloads it would receive as a free app would just be an unwanted support burden. The (few) people who actually want this app know who they are, and I’m betting they are not just willing but <i>happy</i>\n to pay for it.</p>\n\n<p>Are you a classic Mac diehard who still misses some of the old ways? Or maybe you just want to try it to see what it’s like? Even if you don’t want the classic behavior to be the default, you can switch to “modern” mode and use Shift-click to trigger the “classic” behavior. It beats mousing down to a Dock icon, right?</p>\n\n<p>I’m just glad this app exists. I had a ton of fun working on it. Thanks to Lee for being a kindred spirit when it comes to classic Mac OS, and to all my other Mac-nerd friends who offered advice and code during development—especially <a href=\"http://shapeof.com\">Gus Mueller</a>, maker of <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com\">many fine Mac apps</a>, who provided a surprising performance enhancement for our tiny app. I’m excited to finally be able to use this badge on my website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"app-store-badge\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/front-and-center/id1493996622?ls=1&amp;mt=12\"><img src=\"/images/download-on-mac-app-store.svg\" height=\"40\" alt=\"Download Front and Center on the Mac App Store\" style=\"display:block;margin:auto;\"></a></p>",

When I was a kid, I spent a lot of time looking over the TV listings. Each daily newspaper had the TV listings for that day, but there was also a weekly TV guide that came with the Sunday paper. This was the one I’d pore over while eating breakfast each morning.</p>\n\n<p>The weekly guide had a section where it listed all the movies that were airing on TV that week. Each movie was accompanied by a short, plain-spoken description of the plot. In addition to the star ratings (where the maximum was four stars, I believe), the descriptions also sometimes included a few words about the quality of the movie or performances. Something like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"tv-listing\" >\n<div><span class=\"rating\">★★★★</span> <b class=\"title\">JAWS</b></div>\n<div class=\"description\">(Adventure, 1975) A killer shark terrorizes a beachside town. Suspenseful and thrilling. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss. (2 hrs. 4 min.)</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"tv-listing\">\n<div><span class=\"rating\">★★★</span> <b class=\"title\">FERRIS BUELLER’S DAY OFF</b></div>\n<div class=\"description\">(Comedy, 1986) A high school student evades parents and the school principal to take a day off from school. Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck. (1 hr. 43 min.)</div>\n</div>\n\n<!--\n<div class=\"tv-listing\">\n<div><span class=\"rating\">★★★</span> <b class=\"title\">HIGH NOON</b></div>\n<div class=\"description\">(Western, 1952) A town Marshal faces a gang of outlaws alone at high noon. Gary Cooper, Thomas Mitchell. (1 hr. 25 min.)</div>\n</div>\n-->\n\n<p style=\"clear: both\">One day in the late ’80s or early ’90s, I recall seeing the following entry for the movie Top Gun in the weekly TV guide:\n\n<div class=\"tv-listing big\">\n<div><span class=\"rating\">★★</span> <b class=\"title\">TOP GUN</b></div>\n<div class=\"description\">(Drama, 1986) Trivializes war by turning it into a music video. Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer. (1 hr. 50 min.)</div>\n</div>\n\n<p style=\"clear: both\">There was no description at all, just this frank assessment. After spending years of my life reading these movie summaries, it was as if the author had finally broken through and had spoken with a clear voice for one brief, shining moment. <b><i>Trivializes war by turning it into a music video</i></b>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s now several decades later and I still remember this movie review word-for-word. I have no idea who the author was, or how many similar gems were hidden in the pages of that weekly TV guide over the years. But I credit this tiny act of defiance with inspiring me in multiple ways.</p>\n\n<p>It taught me the power of well-chosen words to shake people out of their daily routines and patterns of thought. It showed me that all jobs, no matter how seemingly dull, can be an outlet for self-expression and excellence. And it reminds me, to this day, that each work of art can be—<i>deserves</i> to be—considered from multiple points of view, not all of which will be comfortable.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 95%\">Note: This post is not a polemic against Top Gun or war movies in general. I have always loved jet fighter planes, and I enjoyed Top Gun when I saw it. This review did not make me hate it. (That said, like most older media, I suspect a modern rewatching will reveal a whole host of problems.) My memory of this capsule review is one of surprise, subversiveness, and delight. The review is a slam on Top Gun, yes, but it’s also a celebration of the indomitable human spirit. Four stars.</p>",

      "content": "<p>According to any reasonable set of quantifiable measures, Jony Ive <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/jony-ive-to-form-independent-design-company-with-apple-as-client/\">departs  Apple</a> as the greatest product designer who has ever lived. His hit products sold in vast numbers and were fundamentally transformative to both the company he worked for and the world at large. We all know their names: iMac, iPod, iPhone, iPad. Together, these products helped set the direction for the most consequential industry of the last century.</p>\n\n<p>As the leader of design at Apple, Ive inevitably receives acclaim for work done by other people on his team. This is what it means to be the public face of a collaborative endeavor involving hundreds of people. Ive himself is the first to credit his team, always using the word \"we\" in his appearances in Apple's design videos. One gets the impression that Ive has historically used \"we\" to refer to the design team at Apple, rather than Apple as a whole, but he certainly never meant it to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_we\">refer to himself</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While the iPhone is obviously the most important product in Ive's portfolio, his most significant and lasting contribution to Apple and the tech industry in general is embodied by a product that he worked on much more directly, and with far less help: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3\">the original iMac</a>.\n\n<p>Aside from dramatically reversing Apple's slide into obscurity, the iMac finally pushed the industry over the hill it had been climbing for decades. Nearly overnight, it went from an industry primarily concerned with technical specifications to one that more closely matches every other mainstream consumer business—one where fashion and aesthetics are not just a part of the appeal of a product, they are often the dominant factor. As much as any individual product design, this is Ive's legacy.</p>\n\n<h2>Zima Blue</h2>\n\n<p>There is a certain predictable progression in the career of creative professionals. In the beginning is the acquisition of basic skills and experience—the tools needed on the road to mastery. Work done in this phase is more likely to be constrained by the orthodoxy of a given industry. The first step to making a great product is to make a competent product. One must know the rules before breaking them.</p>\n\n<p>The lives of creative people are often animated by a few deeply held notions. These may be philosophical, aesthetic, fanciful—anything that stirs the soul. Early creative work often fails to embody these ideals to the satisfaction of the creator. Perhaps one's skills are not yet adequate. Perhaps one lacks the confidence to defy convention to the degree required. An early-career creative professional is surrounded by constraints.</p>\n\n<p>With the acquisition of greater skill and authority comes more freedom. If you're Jony Ive, working in a company where that skill has led to world-changing hit products and their associated fortune and well-deserved corporate promotion, you may find yourself with very few limitations indeed. Everything has come together to <i>finally</i> give you a chance to do it <i>right</i> for once—to get closer than ever to that deeply held notion, that ideal.</p>\n\n<p>It's not hard to guess what animates Ive's design philosophy. He's repeated some variation of it in nearly every Apple product design video. Ive wants to get to the essential nature of a thing. By stripping away the extraneous, we are left with the intrinsic truth of a thing. A successful design should seem obvious in retrospect. It should seem <i>inevitable</i>.</p>\n\n<p>This philosophy has been embodied in the products themselves, and its potency has tracked Ive's career. Early on, technical, financial, and authoritative limits led to designs that today's Ive would likely view as over-complicated: a jigsaw of decorative exterior panels fastened to an inner framework housing a hodgepodge of components.</p>\n\n<p>Contrast this with latter-day products like the unibody Apple laptops, where a single slab of machined aluminum replaced dozens of individual parts and their associated fasteners, seams, squeaks, and rattles. Or look at products like <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/airpods/\">AirPods</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> that seem not to be assembled at all, but rather to have sprung into existence as complete entities. When introducing each similar product or manufacturing advance—each further <i>simplification</i>—Ive's joy has been apparent, even through his usual understated demeanor.</p>\n\n<p>And so we come to the most common criticism of Ive's work. With so few limitations on his power and skills, the spark that animates his creative philosophy has been allowed to burn so brightly that it has overwhelmed everything else. Symmetry overrides utility<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>. Simplicity overrides flexibility<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>. Purity of form overrides quality of function<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>This creative arc is dramatized in spectacular fashion in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788510/reference\">Zima Blue</a>, an animated short that's part of the Netflix anthology series <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80174608\">Love, Death &amp; Robots</a>. I don't want to spoil the ending; suffice it to say that I doubt Jony Ive's career beyond Apple will lead to quite such a dramatic conclusion. But the dogged pursuit of a core animating belief rings true to me.</p>\n\n<h2>Millennium Designer</h2>\n\n<p>If Ive has overstayed his usefulness at Apple, it is only by a little. Few careers in any field will ever match his run at Apple. His designs changed the tech industry forever, and he hit home run after home run on the playing field that he built.</p>\n\n<p>It's often said that the best creative work requires limitations. In this case, another piece of industry wisdom also applies: <a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/2014/04/27/creativity-inc\">success hides problems</a>. But in the years to come, when I look back on Jony Ive's work at Apple, I doubt I'll dwell much on the tail end, when he very nearly caught that thing he'd been pursuing for his entire career. Will he ever catch it? Does anyone? I'm not sure it matters to me. After all, it's the chase that I love.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\"><p>MacBook keyboard layout; iMac puck mouse. <a href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"return to article\">↩</a></p></li>\n\n<li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:2\"><p>2013 Mac Pro; MacBook port variety and count. <a href=\"#fnref:2\" title=\"return to article\">↩</a></p></li>\n\n<li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:3\"><p>Apple TV remote; butterfly keyboard. <a href=\"#fnref:3\" title=\"return to article\">↩</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

It’s mostly limited to games that it’s possible to play today without too much trouble. As the games get older (and therefore harder to find and play), the selection criteria get stricter. I don’t go much further back than the 1990s, which ends up excluding my beloved classic Macintosh games. Maybe I’ll do a separate list of those someday.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.destinythegame.com\">Destiny</a> series of games is omitted because it’s very difficult to go back and play this kind of multiplayer online game after the community has moved on. But I do love Destiny…even if it doesn’t always love me back.</p>\n\n<p>I could write many thousands of words about each game, but my failure to do so has prevented me from making this list for too long. In an effort to get the ball rolling, this list does not feature much commentary. It’s mostly just a list, with some information about how and where to play each game. This list is updated as new games warrant inclusion.</p>\n\n<p>The games are listed in no particular order.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#journey\">Journey</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#edith-finch\">What Remains of Edith Finch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#sayonara-wild-hearts\">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#inside\">Inside</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#brothers\">Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#firewatch\">Firewatch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#ico\">Ico</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#shadow-of-the-colossus\">Shadow of the Colossus</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-last-guardian\">The Last Guardian</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-last-of-us\">The Last of Us</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#uncharted-4\">Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#zelda-botw\">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#zelda-tp\">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#zelda-ww\">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#zelda-oot\">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#portal\">Portal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#portal-2\">Portal 2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mario-64\">Super Mario 64</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2 id=\"journey\"><a href=\"http://thatgamecompany.com/journey/\">Journey</a></h2>\n\n<p>Available on PS3 as a <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/journey-ps3/\">download</a>, on PS4 as a <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA00694_00-JOURNEYPS4061115\">download</a> and a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2HbD1iz\">collector’s edition disc</a> bundled with two other games, on <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/journey/home\">PC via the EPIC Store</a> or <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/638230/Journey/\">Steam</a>, and on <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/journey/id1445593893\">iOS</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is the most accessible game on the list.

The GameCube version is a straight port of the N64 original with no significant improvement to the graphics. It’s a tough call, but I guess I recommend going back in time to 1998 and playing the N64 original when its graphics were cutting-edge.

Its spare depiction of a boy attempting to escape from a vast castle with the help of a mysterious companion discarded the gameplay and interface conventions of its day, delivering an almost meditative sense of immersion. Ueda’s next game, , added the bare minimum of status indicators to the screen to support its complex boss battles that required the player to clamber up and onto a succession of giant creatures.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumito_Ueda\">Fumito Ueda’s</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ico\">Ico</a><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/11/masterpiece-ico/\">masterpiece</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus\">Shadow of the Colossus</a></p><p>In terms of both gameplay and mood, Ueda’s latest game, , is a straightforward combination of its predecessors. It features a boy attempting to escape from a mysterious castle with the help of a giant creature. Like Ico, it eschews a conventional , save system, inventory management, power-ups, and nearly every other modern gaming convention. And as in Shadow of the Colossus, players will find themselves scrambling up the back of a large, often uncooperative, incredibly life-like beast (cheekily named Trico).<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2hIRrdT\">The Last Guardian</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUD_(video_gaming)\">HUD</a></p><p>Ico was able to deliver on the promise of its design by reducing complexity in other areas. It’s set in a largely rectilinear castle that the player navigates on foot. It has a small number of enemies. Its environmental puzzles are mechanically and conceptually simple. Similarly, Shadow of the Colossus manages to pull off its extremely ambitious boss battles by removing nearly everything from the game except those creatures.</p><p>While The Last Guardian attempts to combine the strengths of its predecessors, it’s burdened by the combination of their features. The environment and the player’s movement through it is far more complex than in Ico. The puzzles play fast and loose with their own rules at a few critical points. The giant creature, no longer confined to a limited engagement in a boss arena, sometimes pushes the game mechanics past their limits.</p><p>Nothing kills immersion more than an acute awareness of the game engine itself. In The Last Guardian, the camera often gets stuck on walls or briefly shows the view from inside Trico. (Spoiler alert: like all your favorite 3D-rendered characters, he’s hollow.) Arguably, Shadow of the Colossus had an even more frustrating camera and control scheme, but that game was released eleven years ago on a far less powerful console. The Last Guardian has made tremendous strides since then, but it’s still not quite enough to avoid illusion-breaking lapses.</p><p>These shortcomings are compounded by an uncharacteristic lack of faith in its design. Traditional (read: oppressive) on-screen prompts describing the control scheme mar the opening of the game and are impossible to completely banish. A voice-over extends beyond its narrative role to provide a dynamic hint system that is often too quick to reveal solutions. Several brief cutscenes in quick succession at the start of the game undercut player agency. It's tempting to attribute these lapses to  several years before its release, but the reason is less important than the result.<a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-12-13-the-last-guardian-sony-confirms-fumito-uedas-departure\">Ueda’s departure from the project</a></p><p>All of that said, it’s important to remember the context of these criticisms. Ico and Shadow of the Colossus are two of the greatest video games ever created. Both pushed the limits of the hardware they were released on, and both have influenced video game designers, filmmakers, and other creative professionals far out of proportion with their modest sales numbers. That The Last Guardian fails to resoundingly best its distinguished parents is only disappointing because of how close it comes.</p><p>Let’s start with the obvious. The Last Guardian is a gorgeous game. The world design is in line with Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, but the increased fidelity of the PlayStation 4 really makes it shine. ( running at 1080p is recommended for best frame rates.) Lighting effects that Ico could only dream of add a poignancy to already majestic vistas. At so many points, I wished this game had the  from .<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2hINeEH\">PlayStation 4 Pro</a><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/05/05/uncharted-4-photo-mode-screenshot-gallery/\">photo mode</a><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2gZcveM\">Uncharted 4</a></p><p>Trico is an amazing achievement: a building-sized  that truly feels alive.

      "link": "http://hypercritical.co/2015/04/15/os-x-reviewed",
      "content": "<p>Nearly 15 years ago, I wrote my <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/1999/12/macos-x-dp2/\">first</a> review of  Mac OS X for a nascent “<a href=\"http://archive.arstechnica.com/reviews/4q99/macos-x-dp2/m-macos-x-dp2-1.html\">PC enthusiast’s</a>\" website called <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com\">Ars Technica</a>. Last fall, I wrote <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/10/os-x-10-10/\">my last</a>. Though Apple will presumably announce the next major version of OS X at <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/\">WWDC this coming June</a>, I won’t be reviewing it for Ars Technica or any other publication, including the website you’re reading now.</p>\n\n<p>Those who listen to the <a href=\"http://atp.fm\">ATP</a>, the weekly podcast I host with <a href=\"http://www.marco.org\">Marco Arment</a> and <a href=\"http://www.caseyliss.com\">Casey Liss</a>, know that I’ve been contemplating hanging up my OS X reviewer’s hat for some time now.  Producing thousands of words (and hundreds of screenshots) about each major release of OS X was my first real claim to fame on the Internet. The prospect of stopping has made me reconsider my public identity and sense of self.  Who am I if I’m not “that guy who writes those OS X reviews”?  But when I finally decided, the relief I felt let me know I’d made the right choice.</p>\n\n<p>There is no single, dramatic reason behind this. It’s an accumulation of small things—the time investment, the (admittedly, self-imposed) mental anguish, the pressure to meet my own expectations and those of my readers year after year—but it all boils down to a simple, pervasive feeling that this is the time to stop. I’ve done this. It is done.</p>\n\n<p>When I started, I was at the forefront of long-form nerd-centric tech writing. Today, the world has moved on. I might have stopped with my <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/\">OS X 10.9 review</a> in 2013 if not for my love of round numbers and my expectation that <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/10/os-x-10-10/\">OS X 10.10</a> would bring a <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/10/os-x-10-10/9/#interface\">complete interface overhaul</a> that I really wanted to write about.</p>\n\n<p>While OS X reviews were my public debut, the <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/hypercritical\">Hypercritical podcast</a> brought me to a new audience starting in 2011. Hypercritical ran for 100 episodes, and in the years that followed I’ve recorded at least one podcast every week. (I’m currently a co-host of the weekly <a href=\"http://atp.fm/\">Accidental Tech Podcast</a> and a regular guest on <a href=\"http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/\">The Incomparable</a>.) The one, long article I wrote about OS X for Ars Technica every year or two has long since been dwarfed by the <a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/about/appearances/\">volume</a> of my audio output.</p>\n\n<p>I still love OS X—and I still have many complaints about it. I will certainly talk about OS X 10.11 (whatever it’s called) at length on <a href=\"http://atp.fm\">ATP</a>, and I’ll read the many great reviews written by others when it’s released.  But neither podcasting nor writing have ever been full-time jobs for me. I’ve always had to fit them into my life alongside my actual job and my family. Right now, I’m looking forward to my first summer in many years that won’t be dominated by stolen daytime minutes and long, sleepless nights in front of a screen with a noisy air conditioner blowing behind me. I’m content to have reviewed 10.0 through 10.10. Someone else can pick up the baton for the next 15 years.</p>\n\n<hr id=\"links\">\n\n<h3 id=\"releases\">Releases</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/10/os-x-10-10/\">OS X 10.10 Yosemite</a> – October 16, 2014</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/\">OS X 10.9 Mavericks</a> – October 22, 2013</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/07/os-x-10-8/\">OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion</a> – July 25, 2012</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7/\">Mac OS X 10.7 Lion</a> – July 20, 2011</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6/\">Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard</a> – August 31, 2009</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/\">Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard</a> – October 28, 2007</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2005/04/macosx-10-4/\">Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger</a> – April 28, 2005</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2003/11/macosx-10-3/\">Mac OS X 10.3 Panther</a> – November 9, 2003</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2002/09/macosx-10-2/\">Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar</a> – September 5, 2002</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2001/10/macosx-10-1/\">Mac OS X 10.1</a> (Puma) – October 15, 2001</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2001/04/macos-x/\">Mac OS X 10.0</a>  (Cheetah) – April 2, 2001</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"retrospectives\">Retrospectives</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/05/mac-os-x-revisited/\">Here’s to the crazy ones: a decade of Mac OS X reviews</a> – May 12, 2011</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2006/03/osx-fiveyears/\">Five years of Mac OS X</a> – March 24, 2006</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"prerelease\">Pre-release</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2010/09/macos-x-beta/\">Mac OS X Public Beta</a> – October 3, 2000</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2000/06/macos-x-qa-1/\">Mac OS X Q &amp; A</a> – June 20, 2000</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2000/05/mac-os-x-dp4/\">Mac OS X DP4</a> – May 24, 2000</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2000/02/mac-os-x-dp3/\">Mac OS X DP3: Trial by Water</a> – February 28, 2000</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2000/01/macos-x-gui/\">Mac OS X Update: Quartz &amp; Aqua</a> – January 17, 2000</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/1999/12/macos-x-dp2/\">Mac OS X DP2</a> – December 14, 1999</li>\n</ul>",

This is the eleventh major release of OS X, and I've <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/author/john-siracusa/\">reviewed them all</a>.  There are several ways to read my review.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/10/os-x-10-10/\">Read it for free on the web</a></li>\n\n<li> <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/os-x-10.10-yosemite-ars-technica/id928630628?mt=11&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l6SN\">Buy it from Apple’s iBookstore for $4.99</a>\n\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OFLKWTY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00OFLKWTY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=siracusa-20&amp;linkId=WD7GDMIPVQ63BLSX\">Buy it from Amazon’s Kindle store for $4.99</a>\n\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/subscriptions/\">Subscribe to Ars Premier for a month for $5</a> and get <i>all</i> of these options:\n\n<ul>\n<li> Read it on a single, ad-free web page</li>\n<li> Download an iBooks-compatible EPUB file</li>\n<li> Download a Kindle ebook: two versions, one made especially for iOS</li>\n</ul>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are my thoughts on the various reading options. This is mostly a repeat of <a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/2013/10/22/mavericks\">last year’s post about Mavericks</a>, with some text carried over verbatim, but there is some new information.</p>\n\n<h2>The Web Version</h2>\n\n<p>The web version of my review is the canonical version.  It has the best formatting, the biggest images, and includes mouse-over image toggle effects that can't be done in an ebook.  It's also the most up-to-date.  I believe that good writing for the web includes many links.  A web browser is the best place to inspect and follow those links.</p>\n\n<p>All the images in my review are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_Display\">Retina</a> resolution.  To see all the detail in the images, read the review on a screen with at least 1,920 “native” pixels of horizontal resolution.  Most images are 1,280 pixels wide (presented to the browser with a width value of 640), but the “full-width” images are 1,920 pixels wide (presented to the browser with a width value of 960).</p>\n\n<p>The free web version has ads, and it’s split up into multiple “pages” (which are usually much longer than a single printed page).  This kind of pagination annoys some people.  I actually like it for very long articles because it helps me keep my place across multiple reading sessions.  I can remember I was on page 8 instead of remembering the exact point in a very long, scrolling web page.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I also really like how an <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/subscriptions/\">Ars Premier subscription</a> eliminates all ads from the Ars Technica website and gives me the option to view any article on a single page.  I use single-page view on very long articles when I’m searching for some text using my web browser’s “Find…” feature.  I use it all the time on short articles.</p>\n\n<p>Some people think Ars Technica forces me to break my article up into many tiny pages.  That’s not the case.  I choose how to paginate the article.  I like to break it up on logical section boundaries, which means that the “pages” vary widely in length.  I do try to keep any single “page” from being too short, however.</p>\n\n<h2>The eBooks</h2>\n\n<p>My review is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/os-x-10.10-yosemite-ars-technica/id928630628?mt=11&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l6SN\">available on Apple’s iBookstore</a> as well as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008OYE8O8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008OYE8O8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=siracusa-20\">Amazon.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Kindle and iBooks readers for OS X and iOS have their own strengths and weaknesses, but I think the iBooks version of my review has a slight edge over the Kindle version.  Amazon adds a “delivery” charge of $0.15 per megabyte (varying a bit for different countries).  This can really eat into the price of a $4.99 book.  Like the web version, both ebook versions include Retina-resolution images, making them quite large.  To control the size of the Kindle ebook, I used JPEG images throughout.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Amazon, Apple does not charge a per-megabyte fee in its ebook store.  Since both ebooks are the same price, this means I make slightly more money from each iBookstore purchase than I do from each Kindle purchase.  But there’s something in it for you, too. The iBookstore version of my review uses lossless PNG images throughout.  (Kindle version: 5 MB; iBookstore version: 25 MB.)  In practice, I doubt most people will be able to tell the difference between the JPEG and PNG images, but I know which one I’d choose.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried to make both ebooks available for purchase in as many countries as possible, but there are some limits on this that are beyond my control.  If the ebook is not available in your country, remember that you can get both versions of the ebook by <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/subscriptions/\">subscribing to Ars Premier</a>.<p>\n\n<h2>The Stats</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li> 26,485 words.</li>\n<li> 113 images (54.3 MB)</li>\n<li> 479 original screenshots (3.56 GB)</li>\n<li> 8,283 words of research notes.</li>\n<li> 2,534 lines of Perl code across 12 scripts to generate three different formats from the canonical HTML source: Ars CMS, EPUB, and Kindle.\n<li> All three formats were generated 171 times.\n<li> I saved the document 3,525 times while writing it in <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">BBEdit</a>.</li>\n<li> The article content was constantly backed up onto 7 different hard drives on three different Macs in two different locations (thanks to <a href=\"http://db.tt/KgXbHWr\">Dropbox</a>, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/14/#time-machine\">Time Machine</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/\">SuperDuper</a>), and pushed up to two different online backup services (<a href=\"http://www.backblaze.com/\">Backblaze</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crashplan.com/\">CrashPlan</a>).</li>\n<li> Applications used: <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">BBEdit</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nuance.com/for-individuals/by-product/dragon-for-mac/dragon-dictate/index.htm\">Dragon Dictate</a>, <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2523\">TextEdit</a>, <a href=\"http://simplenote.com\">Simplenote</a>, <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html\">Photoshop CS6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/\">VMware Fusion</a>, <a href=\"http://xscopeapp.com\">xScope</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/xcode/\">Xcode</a>, <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/\">Yojimbo</a>.\n</ul>\n\n<p>My sincere thanks to everyone who reads the review, in any form, in whole or in part.

Good books about the latter often turn into the former by the end.</p><p>The book I just finished,  by , co-founder of , had a head start on both counts.  My love of Pixar is not surprising or uncommon.  As for Ed Catmull, I’ve been aware of him and his contemporaries for decades (I had an  quote in my  for a while in the 90s), but my nerd crush really stepped into high gear when I saw  at the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2007.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FUZQYBO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00FUZQYBO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=siracusa-20\">Creativity, Inc.</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Catmull\">Ed Catmull</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar\">Pixar</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvy_Ray_Smith\">Alvy Ray Smith</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature_block\">.sig</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2h2lvhzMDc\">a video of Catmull’s talk</a></p><p>It’s difficult for me to describe my reaction to that talk—and to his new book—without sounding absurdly self-aggrandizing, but I’m going to give it a shot.  Saying what other people are thinking is a proven formula for mass-market appeal employed by everyone from talk radio hosts to stand-up comedians.  But as someone whose thoughts and interests have always been outside the norm, I’ve rarely heard excerpts from my own inner dialog voiced on a broader stage.</p><p>Ed Catmull does that for me.  If you’ve listened to my  or read , you will find many familiar topics and themes in Creativity, Inc.  Now, believe me, I harbor no illusions about this overlap.  I am not the guy who hears  tell a joke and thinks he could be just as funny because he had a similar thought once.  But shared values and the fulfillment of common aspirations are at the heart of all hero worship.<a href=\"http://5by5.tv/hypercritical\">Hypercritical podcast</a><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/staff/2009/05/hypercritical/\">the article that inspired it</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_C.K.\">Louis C.K.</a></p><p>Ed Catmull’s dream was to create the first fully computer-animated feature film.  As a child, I also dreamed of such a thing; Catmull and the rest of the people at Pixar actually made it happen.  Similarly, as an adult, I’ve clung to the notion that .  Creativity, Inc. explains just how powerful it can be when practiced by a handful of the most brilliant technical and creative people alive today.<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/staff/2009/05/hypercritical/\">critical thinking can be both useful and powerful</a></p><p>Ay, there’s the rub.  It’s so easy to hear the vaguest echo of your own thoughts expressed by someone fantastically smart and accomplished and view that as a cosmic endorsement of your approach to life.  But that absolutely would not be in keeping with the message of the book—a message Catmull tries again and again to communicate to readers he knows will resist it.</p><p>Indeed, Catmull most often uses himself as an example of someone who has failed to see through to the heart of a problem.  This is the true strength of the book.  Unlike so many other tech-industry memoirs and business books, Creativity, Inc. is not an abstract exploration of a philosophy, nor is it a list of accomplishments interspersed with bold commandments.  Instead, it is a deep, thoughtful investigation of a never-ending series of failures—and the reactions to those failures that eventually led to success.</p><p>Think of it: the man who invented , made computer-animated films possible, and led his studio to release a string of amazing, - examples of the form decides to write a book…and then builds it around an examination of his own mistakes.  Ed Catmull may not be your kind of hero, but he sure is mine.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping\" title=\"FFS!\">texture mapping</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_awards_and_nominations_(feature_films)\">Oscar</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_awards_and_nominations_(short_films)\">winning</a></p></div></div>",

I was  to get a  in 1984, and it changed my life.  I spent so many hours in front of that computer, I often look back in wonder at how I found so much to do with so little. This was years before I had an Internet connection.  I had very little software and no convenient way to get more. My dollar-a-week allowance didn’t go very far.

But this is not the only road to geekdom.<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.06/apple.html\">the dark times</a></p><p>The Mac is actually one of the few things I’m a geek about that I’ve been in on since the start.  Geekdom is not defined by historical entry points or even shared experiences.  A geek must possess just two things: knowledge and enthusiasm.</p><p>I became interested in remote control cars in high school after seeing a friend drive one in his backyard.  He’d been building and racing RC cars since he was in elementary school.  I was fascinated by these machines, but I worried I’d never be a “real” RC car geek like my friend.</p><p>I saved my money, bought a , built it (badly) myself—and then crashed it.  Undaunted, I bought replacement parts, fixed it, learned to drive it with far less crashing, and eventually bought a .  Most importantly, I subscribed to  magazine and read every issue from cover to cover as soon as they arrived at my house.<a href=\"http://www.iconicrc.com/2011/02/3116-kyosho-turbo-ultima/\">car</a><a href=\"http://www.rc10talk.com/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=23937#p238822\">better car</a><a href=\"http://www.rccaraction.com/\">Radio Control Car Action</a></p><p>A year or so later, I found myself in my local hobby shop answering another customer’s questions about his car.  It started to dawn on me that I now knew more about RC cars than the average hobby shop patron.  I was no longer an outsider looking in.</p><p>Around the same time, I was engaged in one of those  marketing schemes that led to me having to select some CDs on a whim.  I ended up getting , and it knocked my socks off.  I’d been aware of U2 for years and had probably heard the hits from  on the radio dozens of times, but I’d never really been into the band—or any band, for that matter.

I bought and read  of the band.  At my local library, I devoured reviews of all their past albums in  and . I found every magazine with a  about U2.

Dissatisfied with the state of lyrics websites (some things ), I transcribed every U2 album, single, b-side, and rarity, leading to the creation of my first public website, The U2 Lyrics Archive.

If you have an iOS device plus either an HDMI output cable ( or ) or an , you can use the simple  application to dial in your color, contrast, brightness, and other basic settings.<a href=\"http://www.imagingscience.com\">ISF</a><a href=\"http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD826ZM/A/lightning-digital-av-adapter\">Lightning</a><a href=\"http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD098ZM/A/apple-digital-av-adapter\">30-pin</a><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/appletv/\">Apple TV</a><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/thx-tune-up/id592624594?mt=8\">THX tune-up</a></p><p>Before calibrating, don’t forget to turn off all the “image enhancement” features of your TV.  These are the things with names like Vivid Color, Color Remaster, Motion Interpolation, Brilliance Enhancer, Black Extension, C.A.T.S., AGC, and so on.  Check your TV’s manual for explanations of what each setting does, if you’re curious, but you really do want to turn them all .  They all mess with the image in ways not intended by the creator, and they will make proper calibration more difficult or impossible.<i>off</i></p><p>There’s one setting in particular that anyone can adjust without requiring any skill or special software. Let’s say you buy a new  HDTV with a native resolution of 1920×1080.  Out of the box, that TV will most likely be configured to never show you a full 1920×1080 pixels of information.  In computer parlance, it’s running at a non- resolution by default, like a 1024×768 LCD display set to a resolution of 800×600.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p\">1080p</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_resolution\">native</a></p><p>Imagine this test image exactly matches the native resolution of your HDTV.

Send this image to your HDTV, however, and this is what you’re likely to see:<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_Display\">Retina</a></p><p>The green box is no longer visible; the squares in the corners are now rectangles; the fine lines are now blurred together, producing an unpleasant .  You can read all about the origins of this terrible behavior in the Wikipedia entry on “,” but all you need to know is that it’s no longer necessary in the age of HDTV.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moire_pattern\">moiré pattern</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overscan#Origins_of_overscan\">overscan</a></p><p>You paid for all 1920×1080 pixels of your fancy new HDTV—use them!  Most HDTVs have a setting somewhere to correct this problem.  It may be called “Overscan,” “1:1 Pixel Mapping,” “Native,” “Screen Fit,” “Just Scan,” or something even more generic like “Size 1” or “Size 2.”  Consult your TV’s manual to find out. (If you can’t find your paper manual, a Google search for your TV’s model number followed by “manual PDF” will usually lead to an online version.)  Don’t give up; the setting is almost always there somewhere.

      "content": "<p>I reviewed <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/\">OS X 10.9 Mavericks</a> for <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/\">Ars Technica</a>.  I’ve been reviewing OS X since 1999, and this is the tenth major release.  There are several ways to read my review.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/\">Read it for free on the web</a></li>\n\n<li> <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/os-x-10.9-mavericks-ars-technica/id728112618?mt=11&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l6SN\">Buy it from Apple’s iBookstore for $4.99</a>\n\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G3J8NPQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00G3J8NPQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=siracusa-20\">Buy it from Amazon’s Kindle store for $4.99</a>\n\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/subscriptions/\">Subscribe to Ars Premier for a month for $5</a> and get <i>all</i> of these options:\n\n<ul>\n<li> Read it on a single, ad-free web page</li>\n<li> Download an iBooks-compatible EPUB file</li>\n<li> Download a Kindle ebook: two versions, one made especially for iOS</li>\n</ul>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are my thoughts on the various reading options. This is mostly a repeat of <a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/2012/07/25/mountain-lion\">last year’s post about Mountain Lion</a>, with some sections carried over verbatim, but there is some new information.</p>\n\n<h2>The Web Version</h2>\n\n<p>The web version of my review is the canonical version.  It has the best formatting and the most features.  It's also the most up-to-date.  I believe that good writing for the web includes many links.  A web browser is the best place to inspect and follow those links.</p>\n\n<p>This year, all the images in my review are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_Display\">Retina</a> resolution.  To see all the detail in the images, read the review on a Retina iPad, Mac, or other device with at least around 1,400 “native” pixels of horizontal resolution.  (The “full-width” images are 1,280 pixels wide, presented to the browser with a width value of 640, but there are also margins around the content column.) </p>\n\n<p>The free web version has ads, and it’s split up into multiple “pages” (which are usually much longer than a single printed page).  This kind of pagination annoys some people.  I actually like it for very long articles because it helps me keep my place across multiple reading sessions.  I can remember I was on page 8 instead of remembering the exact point in a very long, scrolling web page.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I also really like how an <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/subscriptions/\">Ars Premier subscription</a> eliminates all ads from the Ars Technica website and gives me the option to view any article on a single page.  I use single-page view on very long articles when I’m searching for some text using my web browser’s “Find…” feature.  I use it all the time on short articles.</p>\n\n<p>Some people think Ars Technica forces me to break my article up into many tiny pages.  That’s not the case.  I choose how to paginate the article.  I like to break it up on logical section boundaries, which means that the “pages” vary widely in length.  I do try to keep any single “page” from being too short, however.</p>\n\n<h2>The eBooks</h2>\n\n<p>For the first time, my review is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/os-x-10.9-mavericks-ars-technica/id728112618?mt=11&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l6SN\">available on Apple’s iBookstore</a> as well as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008OYE8O8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008OYE8O8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=siracusa-20\">Amazon.com</a>.  The new iBooks application bundled with Mavericks means you can also read the iBookstore version on your Mac.</p>\n\n<p>The Kindle and iBooks readers for OS X and iOS have their own strengths and weaknesses, but I think the iBooks version of my review has a slight edge over the Kindle version.  Amazon adds a “delivery” charge of $0.15 per megabyte (varying a bit for different countries).  This can really eat into the price of a $4.99 book.  Like the web version, both ebook versions include Retina-resolution images this year, making them much larger than in past years.  To control the size of the Kindle ebook, I used JPEG images throughout.  (Last year’s Kindle ebook used a mix of JPEG and PNG images for the same reason.)</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Amazon, Apple does not charge a per-megabyte fee in its ebook store.  Since both ebooks are the same price, this means I make slightly more money from each iBookstore purchase than I do from each Kindle purchase.  But there’s something in it for you, too. The iBookstore version of my review uses lossless PNG images throughout.  (Kindle version: 5.5 MB; iBookstore version: 30.5 MB.)  In practice, I doubt most people will be able to tell the difference between the JPEG and PNG images, but I know which one I’d choose.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"unknowns\">The Unknowns</h2>\n\n<p>This year is the first time I haven’t known the price and release date of a major OS X release well in advance.  The lead times dictated by the ebook stores (anywhere from 12 hours to a week) meant that I had to submit the ebooks before I knew how much Mavericks would cost.  The ebooks are now updated, but Amazon in particular does not make downloading updates easy or convenient.  Updates to the web version are visible instantly, of course.</p>\n\n<h2>The Stats</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li> 24,008 words.</li>\n<li> 110 images (36.7 MB)</li>\n<li> 499 original screenshots (666.2 MB)</li>\n<li> 3,011 words of research notes.</li>\n<li> 2,206 lines of Perl code across 14 scripts to generate three different formats from the canonical HTML source: Ars CMS, EPUB, and Kindle.\n<li> All three formats were generated 98 times.\n<li> I saved the document 2,653 times while writing it in <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">BBEdit</a>.</li>\n<li> The article content was constantly backed up onto 7 different hard drives on three different Macs in two different locations (thanks to <a href=\"http://db.tt/KgXbHWr\">Dropbox</a>, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/14/#time-machine\">Time Machine</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/\">SuperDuper</a>), and pushed up to two different online backup services (<a href=\"http://www.backblaze.com/\">Backblaze</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crashplan.com/\">CrashPlan</a>).</li>\n<li> Applications used: <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">BBEdit</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nuance.com/for-individuals/by-product/dragon-for-mac/dragon-dictate/index.htm\">Dragon Dictate</a>, <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2523\">TextEdit</a>, <a href=\"http://simplenoteapp.com/\">Simplenote</a>, <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopextended.html\">Photoshop CS6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html\">VMware Fusion</a>, <a href=\"http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope/\">xScope</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/xcode/\">Xcode</a>, <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/\">Yojimbo</a>.\n</ul>\n\n<p>My sincere thanks to everyone that reads the review, in any form, in whole or in part.

It’s this same compulsion that has briefly driven me out of my months-long -review-writing haze to offer my own perspective.<a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/nintendo_in_motion\">offer their heartfelt suggestions</a><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/\">Mavericks</a></p><p>I agree that Nintendo is in trouble.  Before considering possible solutions, I’m forced to ask a tougher question:  it be saved?  , that it’s only a matter of time.  I think it comes down to this.  As long as there continues to be a market for devices that are primarily designed to play games, then it’s possible for Nintendo to live to fight another day.<i>can</i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/374389005304885248\">Some say no</a></p><p>If not, then I fear the worst.  Nintendo is not equipped to produce and maintain a long-lived,  software platform.   companies have ever done it.  You know all their names: Microsoft, Apple, Google.  I don’t expect to ever see Nintendo on that list.<i>general-purpose</i><a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/2013/03/19/self-reliance\">Precious few</a></p><p>I think there is still a market for game-only (or at least “game-mostly”) hardware products.  I’m not sure how long it will last, but I’m betting this  will sell well enough in the aggregate to maintain the status quo, at the very least.<a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/2013/05/28/next-generation\">upcoming generation of consoles</a></p><p>Assuming I’m right, Nintendo has all the tools it needs to pull itself out of its current tailspin.  To understand how, just look at how Nintendo has always done it: with hardware and software working together to provide new, fun experiences.</p><p>The  was Nintendo’s first big video game success.  After the  of the 1980s, home video game software alone was not going to lead Nintendo to riches.  Personal computers were still expensive and wouldn’t have mass-market penetration for years.  Any attempt to field an -like hardware product would surely be met with skepticism.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System\">NES</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_video_game_crash_of_1983\">game console crash</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600\">Atari-2600</a></p><p>Nintendo’s solution required hardware and software.  The hardware: an Atari-like game console, yes, but also…?  Yep, and a , too.  Very few games used these accessories, but you can be sure they were featured heavily in all the initial advertising for the NES.  They were hardware decoys, misdirections.  They existed to get the NES into homes.  Once there, a tiny mustachioed trojan  spilled out of the belly of the beast and conquered a generation of gamers.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.O.B.\">a robot</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES_Zapper\">light gun</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario\">plumber</a></p><p>Now consider the , the company’s first 3D console.  The  and the  beat it to market by years, and both had the good sense to use optical disks instead of cartridges.  Though the PlayStation came to dominate that generation, it was the Nintendo that transformed 3D gaming forever with the potent combination of  and the —hardware and software products that were designed together, and it showed.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N64\">Nintendo 64</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn\">Saturn</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)\">PlayStation</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64\">Super Mario 64</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64_controller\">Nintendo 64 controller</a></p><p>Mario 64 taught the world how to make a good 3D game.  Though it couldn’t save the N64 from an ignominious fate in the market, it left its mark on gaming history and perhaps singlehandedly kept Nintendo relevant.  The idea of releasing a 3D gaming system today without a standard  is absurd, but that’s just what Sega and Sony did in 1994.  After the N64 was revealed to the world, analog sticks quickly appeared on both the  and the — the existing controller, in the latter case, but I’m sure that was only a temporary condition, right?

Nintendo sacrificed hardware power for a novel input method and low price, then paired it with  that explained the value proposition to the world.

And I didn’t even mention the  product line or the dual-screened , two of the top three .  Again, impossible without hardware and software synergy.  This is how Nintendo succeeds.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_line\">Game Boy</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS\">DS</a><a href=\"http://www.vgchartz.com/analysis/platform_totals/\">best-selling gaming platforms of all time</a></p><p>When I read the current crop of advice for Nintendo, much of it focused on how to survive in a world where iOS comes to dominate portable gaming, I think about how it would have helped Nintendo at its previous low points.  , some say.  If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.<a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/nintendo_in_motion\">Nintendo should make games for iOS</a></p><p>At the tail end of the GameCube’s life, Sony had sold many times more consoles and games than Nintendo over the course of a decade.  Should Nintendo have started writing games for the overwhelmingly dominant Sony platform? Would that have helped Nintendo achieve Wii-like success?  I don’t think so; no amount of software alone could have done that.</p><p>The game software business is tough.  It’s hit-driven, like Hollywood.  Most games lose money or break even.  A few big winners fund all the others—if you’re lucky.  A game development studio going out of business shortly after releasing a critically acclaimed game is not unheard of.  (Hell,  .)<a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/2012/11/27/strange-game\">the best game released last year</a><a href=\"http://www.destructoid.com/journey-took-thatgamecompany-into-bankruptcy-244311.phtml\">bankrupted its developer</a></p><p>Consolidation is rampant in game development.  Small players are routinely snatched up by  that have a better capacity to absorb the inevitable losses that come with games that are not monster sales successes.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ea\">behemoths</a></p><p>This is not a world that Nintendo should aspire to enter.  Better to stick with hardware platforms that it controls, profiting from both the hardware sales and the fees collected from third-party games sold on its platforms.  That’s the kind of steady (and potentially enormous) income that will keep Nintendo afloat as it works on the next big thing.</p><p>Even if Nintendo sticks to its guns, and even if the market for game-focused hardware continues to exist, Nintendo still faces some big challenges.  A gaming platform doesn’t have to compete with iOS on its own terms, but it does have to at least match it in the areas that are relevant to gaming.</p><p>Right now, Apple is crushing Nintendo when it comes to the software purchase, installation, and ownership experience.  Hell, even —a PC gaming platform—embarrasses Nintendo’s e-commerce efforts.  My Nintendo games should not be tied to a piece of hardware.  My purchases should transfer seamlessly to any new Nintendo device I purchase.   (or only way) to play classic Nintendo games. Nintendo needs to get  at this stuff—fast.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(software)\">Steam</a><a href=\"http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/nintendo-isnt-losing-to-the-ouyas-high-quality-emulation-of-classic-games-i\">Illegal emulation should not be the easiest way</a><a href=\"http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/99\">much, much better</a></p><p>Apple is also winning when it comes to market access.  It’s much easier for a two-person team to write an iOS game and put it up for sale than it is for that same team to get a game onto a Nintendo platform.  Expensive, formal, limited developer access has no place in the modern gaming world.  Nintendo needs to wake up and smell the App Store.</p><p>A lot of things have to go right for Nintendo to get its mojo back.  It’s worth reiterating: if the market for dedicated gaming hardware disappears, I fear it’s game over for Nintendo as we know it.</p><p>But if the time of the game console is not yet at an end (handheld or otherwise), then Nintendo has a lot of work to do.  It needs to get better at all of the game-related things that iOS is good at.  It needs to produce software that clearly demonstrates the value of its hardware—or, if that’s not possible, then it needs to make new hardware.</p><p>Any advice that leads in a different direction is a distraction.  There’s no point in any plan to “save” Nintendo that fails to preserve what’s best about the company.  Nintendo needs to do what Nintendo does best: create amazing combinations of hardware and software.  That’s what has saved the company in the past, and it’s the only thing that will ensure its future.</p><h2 id=\"schrodingers-console\">Schrödinger’s Console</h2><h2 id=\"how-nintendo-succeeds\">How Nintendo Succeeds</h2><h2 id=\"red-ocean\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy#Blue_ocean_strategy_vs._red_ocean_strategy\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: inherit ! important;\">Red Ocean</a></h2><h2 id=\"ios-does\">iOS Does What Nintendon’t</h2><h2 id=\"lets-a-go\">Let’s-a-Go!</h2></div></div>",

This helped make it the least expensive and the smallest, which only increased its appeal to non-gamers.  The coup de grâce was the Wii’s novel control scheme, which let your dad, who couldn’t get past  back in the 80s, make an improbable transformation into .<a href=\"http://www.mariowiki.com/World_1-1_(Super_Mario_Bros.)\">World 1-1</a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYtVHHM2Fl0\">a hardcore gamer…of a sort</a></p><p>And if the idea of “” a console generation with laughably underpowered hardware wasn’t enough, the Wii and its contemporaries also put an end to the idea of a game console that just plays games.  Just a few years after launch, all of the consoles—even the dainty,  Wii—supported some kind of social networking, photo viewing, and one or more video streaming services.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(seventh_generation)#Sales_standings\">winning</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-definition_television\">standard-definition</a></p><p>Arguably, this movement started to gain momentum with the original PlayStation’s ability to play music CDs, and continued with the PlayStation 2’s secondary role as a DVD player.  But the Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360 definitively moved the entire product category beyond gaming.  In fact, the PlayStation 3 ended up as .<a href=\"http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/12/04/ps3-is-1-for-netflix-streaming-in-the-living-room/\">the most popular way to view Netflix on a TV</a></p><p>This was all a natural consequence of the decreased cost of storage and  combined with the ubiquity of wireless networking.  It was inevitable that any TV-connected box would eventually support these features.  But it also means the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Wii U lack the clarity of purpose enjoyed by the previous generations of game consoles.  Here’s how things look to me at the dawn of the next generation.<a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/6253/intel-by-2020-the-size-of-meaningful-compute-approaches-zero\">computation</a></p><p>Stop me if you’ve heard this one before.  The Wii U is dramatically less powerful than the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.  In place of hardware power, Nintendo is offering an unconventional multi-screen gaming experience using a .  Although pricing has not been announced for its competitors, there’s a reasonable chance the Wii U will end up being the least expensive console in this generation.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U_GamePad\">tablet-style controller</a></p><p>It sure looks like the Wii formula all over again, but there’s a difference this time.  The Wii U’s  is significantly more intimidating to non-gamers than the familiar-looking .  Wii accessories (and games) also work with the Wii U, which is nice, but the GamePad is the face of the new system to consumers.  For former Wii buyers who are intimidated by the GamePad, Wii hardware and software compatibility may only make them further question what the new system really offers beyond the Wii.  And though the Wii U expands on the Wii’s non-gaming features, its  feels half-hearted and has thus far .<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U_GamePad\">GamePad controller</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote\">Wii remote</a><a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/21/nintendo-tvii-for-wii-u-hands-on\">TV integration</a><a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/nintendo-tvii-review-a-great-idea-that-simply-doesnt-work-yet/\">failed to impress</a></p><p>The end result has been  coming out of the 2012 holiday season.  Nintendo’s  of allowing smartphone apps to run on the Wii U seems uncharacteristically desperate.<a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/186734/January_sales_show_continued_rough_tides_for_the_Wii_U.php\">dismal Wii U sales</a><a href=\"http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/05/06/business/nintendo-taps-smartphone-apps-for-console-boost/\">rumored consideration</a></p><p>Thanks to the novelty and accessibility of the Wii remote and the universal appeal of launch titles like , the Wii sold in such huge numbers that third-party developers couldn’t afford to ignore it.  They dutifully cut down the features and graphics quality of their most popular games to get them to run on the Wii.  These games were often terrible, but at least they existed, giving the Wii’s game library “checkbox parity” with the rest of the market.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports\">Wii Sports</a></p><p>Like the Wii, the Wii U is  to run the same games as its competitors.  Unlike the Wii, the Wii U’s sales numbers aren’t high enough to motivate cut-down ports of new games.  That leaves the Wii U with Nintendo’s franchise titles (many of which are not yet available), a   Wii U  from third-party developers, and several ports of   that Nintendo’s new hardware is finally able to run.<a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/08/ea-frostbite-nintendo-wii-u/\">not powerful enough</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZombiU\">scant</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_City_Undercover\">few</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonetta_2\">exclusives</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_3\">-generation<i>previous</i></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex:_Human_Revolution\">games</a></p><p>It’s still  to call this race, but the Wii U certainly looks like it’s in trouble.  It may be that Nintendo has just built the wrong machine.  For the most part, the Wii succeeded  its underpowered hardware, not because of it.  Choosing to produce another “next-generation” console with previous-generation power isolates Nintendo.<a href=\"http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/05/consumers_go_crazy_for_wii_u_following_xbox_one_reveal\">too early</a><i>despite</i></p><p>New multi-platform titles can easily target the Xbox One, the PlayStation 4, and the PC simultaneously.  The Wii U isn’t even in the running—unless it sells so well that a hobbled port is justified.  The same goes for exclusives built around the Wii U’s unique features.  No third-party developer wants to invest in a game that can only ever be sold on a single platform with a tiny installed base.</p><p>I own a Wii U, and I’m  that it really does offer new, fun gaming experiences not available on any other platform.  I’m also a  fan of several of Nintendo’s  .  But I’m not the kind of customer that carried the Wii to head of the class in the previous generation.  I’m the kind that would gladly pay twice the price of a Wii U for the ability to play a Zelda game on a console with the power of the PlayStation 4.  The Wii U is not built for me.  Whatever kind of customer it is built for, there sure don’t seem to be many of them.<a href=\"http://nintendoland.nintendo.com\">convinced</a><a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/2013/01/25/we-can-remember-it-for-you-wholesale\">diehard</a><a href=\"http://mario.nintendo.com\">popular</a><a href=\"http://www.zelda.com\">franchises</a></p><p>Sony is the reigning king of overblown hardware hype, famously promising that the PS2’s  and the PS3’s  would change the face of computing forever.  And maybe they did, in .  But their power was notoriously difficult to unlock.  They became the standard-bearers for the gaming version of the : “May you develop for interesting hardware.”<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_Engine\">emotion engine</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(microprocessor)\">Cell processor</a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cG2D5xv0T4\">a tiny way</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times\">ancient Chinese proverb</a></p><p>Hardware eccentricity has been part and parcel of console development for decades.  And the weirder the hardware, the more likely it is that a straightforward implementation of a game engine will run up against bottlenecks.  The developer laments are familiar.  “If only there were more bandwidth between the CPU and main memory.”  “If only I had just 10% more RAM.”  “If only this console had a much more powerful programmable GPU instead of a  studded with , each with its own tiny local storage.”<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(microprocessor)#Element_Interconnect_Bus_.28EIB.29\">ring bus</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(microprocessor)#Synergistic_Processing_Elements_.28SPE.29\">custom SIMD processors</a></p><p>The PlayStation 4 aims to repent for the sins of both its father and grandfather—and then some.  Unlike its predecessors, it was designed in close cooperation with game developers.  During the design process, new revisions of the PS4 architecture were presented to developers along with a challenge: find the bottleneck.  Every aspect of the system was put through a similar gauntlet, from the shape and travel of the controller triggers to the accuracy of the gyroscopes.</p><p>All game consoles go through some version of this process, but the PlayStation 4 is defined by it.  The hubris of the PS2 and PS3 is nowhere to be found in the PS4.  This is a product of a newly humbled and rededicated Sony.</p><p>And the thing that Sony is rededicated to is , plain and simple.  Sony was the first console maker to really push the idea of a gaming system that does much more than just play games, but now it’s returning to its roots.<i>gaming</i></p><p>The PlayStation 4 is exactly the sort of thing that a hardcore gamer might have envisioned if presented with the product name back in the days when the original PlayStation reigned supreme.  It’s got more of everything, and the vast majority of its resources are bent towards being the best system for developing and playing games.  In this generation of consoles, that’s actually a radical notion.</p><p>The final entrant in this round of the console wars is the most ambitious.  No longer content to walk the old paths blazed by Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, Microsoft is finally making its play for the entire living room.</p><p>Take a peek at the back of the box—a box that looks for all the world like —and you’ll find the hardware incarnation of this ambition: an HDMI .  Any form of entertainment that does not spring from the Xbox One is invited to at least flow through it, to be mediated and controlled by it.  It’s all right there in the name: One box to rule them all.<a href=\"http://news.xbox.com/media?sc_device=lightbox&amp;mediaid=%7B3A902CE6-E7C6-49B6-8D48-9594B8D59E7F%7D\">a futuristic VCR</a><i>input</i></p><p>The  was unabashedly  on everything  games.

But  reveals a system designed to accommodate a much broader vision of home entertainment.<a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/6972/xbox-one-hardware-compared-to-playstation-4\">a closer look</a></p><p>Where the PS4 uses high-speed  RAM, the Xbox One opts for —but also less power-hungry—.  And in the Xbox, that RAM is shared between two separate operating systems running simultaneously: one for games, and one for everything else.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDDR5\">GDDR5</a><a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/6972/xbox-one-hardware-compared-to-playstation-4/2\">slower</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM\">DDR3</a></p><p>These hardware features express two very different usage models.  The PS4 expects to be turned on when in use, then turned “off” afterwards, entering a super-low-power mode during which a tiny auxiliary processor handles housecleaning chores like downloading game content and applying software updates.</p><p>The Xbox One, with its HDMI input and non-game-related OS and apps, expects to be fully powered whenever the television is on.  Thus, Microsoft’s focus on idle power consumption—even at the cost of gaming performance.</p><p>To mitigate this disadvantage, the Xbox One includes 32MB of low-latency embedded  right on the .  This is a common technique, but it leads to increased complexity.  Game developers must now take care to ensure that the right data is in the tiny local eSRAM pool exactly when it’s needed.  A single pool of uniformly fast memory (albeit with higher latency), as in the PS4, is a much simpler arrangement.  Different priorities, different trade-offs.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory\">SRAM</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip\">SoC</a></p><p>(The eSRAM also consumes die space, which, along with power consumption and cost, may have contributed to Microsoft's decision to give the Xbox One  than the PS4.)<a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/6972/xbox-one-hardware-compared-to-playstation-4/2\">33% fewer GPU cores</a></p><p>Then there’s the Xbox One’s companion hardware, the next iteration of Microsoft’s  motion control system.  The first version of this technology, released as an add-on for the Xbox 360, was the : it didn’t work well, but it was amazing that it worked at all.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect\">Kinect</a><a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancingBear\">proverbial dancing bear</a></p><p>The new incarnation comes bundled with every Xbox One, and it dances like a furry Fred Astaire.  It surpasses its predecessor by many multiples in every specification: .  This technology is no joke.<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4353232/kinect-xbox-one-hands-on\">resolution, depth perception, motion tracking, latency, noise cancellation, local computation</a></p><p>But does it make games more fun?  Or, failing that, is it a better way to control a television than a remote control?  Microsoft is betting a lot, in terms of both hardware cost and software support, that the new Kinect will be an essential component of at least one of these activities in a way that the first Kinect was not.</p><p>When I’m feeling optimistic about the Kinect, I think back to the many generations of terrible touch-screen devices that preceded the iPhone.  The history of touch-based interfaces on consumer electronics wasn’t a gradual ramp up to acceptable quality.  The iPhone wasn’t just the next iteration; it was a discontinuity.  Once the technology passed some critical threshold of responsiveness and reliability, it went from a nerdy curiosity to completely mainstream in the blink of an eye.</p><p>I don’t know where that threshold is for multi-sensor full-body motion control and voice recognition, but I do believe it’s out there.  Microsoft does too.  Of course, that belief will be of little consolation to Xbox One owners if the “iPhone moment” is still many years in the future.</p><p>Last generation, Nintendo did something crazy—and it worked.  This generation, everyone is taking big risks.</p><p>Nintendo tried to play the same hand that it won with in the last round, but now finds itself stranded with previous-generation hardware in a next-generation market.  Like Apple in the 90s, Nintendo is a sentimental favorite.  But it took more than just the iMac and the iPod to transform Apple.  The Wii U still has the potential to be an excellent platform for Nintendo’s beloved first-party games, and a low-cost alternative to the PS4 and Xbox One.  Nintendo should , and get busy on the next great thing.<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2006/03/70512?currentPage=all\">milk it for all it’s worth</a></p><p>Sony is betting that the market for game consoles made by and for hardcore gamers has not yet peaked.  If it’s right, Sony is well-positioned to dominate this generation.  If it’s wrong, the PS4 could be Sony’s : the ne plus ultra of game consoles, remembered in equal parts as a technical marvel and a cautionary tale.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce_Goose\" title=\"Way of the Future\">Spruce Goose</a></p><p>Finally, there’s Microsoft, offering us a brief glimpse of the boundless hunger that once defined the company.  But as Microsoft knows , the living room is littered with the bones of past suitors.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_TV\">all too well</a></p><p>I applaud the technical prowess of the Xbox One’s software, particularly the focus on responsiveness.  The  performance when switching between live TV, gaming, and other apps puts all  at “smart” TV interfaces to shame.<a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/features/the-xbox-one-revealed-6408247/\">demonstrated</a><a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/2013/01/07/ces-worse-products-through-software\">previous efforts</a></p><p>That said, I seriously question the public’s appetite for displaying any additional content alongside a TV show or movie.  The “second screen” experience is already well established, and it happens with a device that’s in your hand or on your lap.  Grabbing one third of a large, communal TV screen to look up an actor on  isn’t just unappealing and cumbersome, it’s downright rude.<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/\">IMDB</a></p><p>There are other contexts where the Xbox One’s unique abilities might shine: jumping in and out of a game to check a sports score, for example, or quickly hitting the web to watch an extended version of an interview after finishing an episode of .  Yes, I can see that.<a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com\">The Daily Show</a></p><p>But will it be enough to crown the Xbox One the king of the living room?  As with all TV-connected devices, content is the key.  The Xbox One has games, live TV, and video streaming services covered, but it appears to lack any form of time-shifting functionality.  Given how much popular content remains locked up in broadcast and cable TV packages, there’s no way any box without DVR-like functionality can ever be the One True Interface to “watching television.”</p><p>Luckily for all three companies, things change quickly in this industry.  If a critical mass of programming becomes available on streaming services a few years down the road, the Xbox One could finally fulfill its destiny.</p><p>On the other hand, Microsoft’s new focus could be a giant turn-off to gamers who were expecting an “Xbox 720,” not a Kinect-powered “media center.”  However brief and anecdotal it may be, a  accompanying the Xbox One announcement has to have Microsoft at least a bit worried.  If the gamers who bought the Xbox 360 don’t show up in the expected numbers to buy the Xbox One, I have a hard time believing this monstrous, sensor-festooned device will pull a Wii and capture the imaginations—and dollars—of non-gamers on a grand scale.<a href=\"http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/05/consumers_go_crazy_for_wii_u_following_xbox_one_reveal\">Wii U sales spike</a></p><p>No matter what happens, I  a future where the market is evenly divided between these three very different products.

Thanks to all of you for your support.</p>\n\n<p>(My original post about t-shirts appears below, for historical purposes.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I’ve wanted to create a Hypercritical t-shirt for a while now.  When I saw that my friend and <a href=\"http://atp.fm\">podcast co-host</a> Marco Arment had created <a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2013/05/03/tshirt\">a t-shirt for Marco.org</a> using a new <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com\">Kickstarter</a>-like website called <a href=\"http://teespring.com\">Teespring</a>, I was intrigued.  When I looked at the shipping dates for Marco’s shirt, I realized that it was now or never if I wanted to get Hypercritical shirts into people’s hands in time for <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/\">WWDC</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://teespring.com\">Teespring website</a> made it incredibly easy to get a shirt up for sale.  In hindsight, doing this in the middle of the night on a Friday was perhaps not the best idea, but that’s what I did.  In less than 30 minutes, I’d created the artwork, uploaded it, and started the sale.  The rest of the weekend was a bit of a blur.  I worked with the Teespring staff (and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/330710221087465472\">people on Twitter</a>) to improve the artwork I’d created in haste, and to make more colors and styles available.</p>\n\n<p>Teespring is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/alextaub/2013/01/03/teespring-is-this-rhode-island-based-startup-the-future-of-custom-apparel/\">a relatively young company</a>, and the user-facing interface on the site doesn’t yet support adding multiple colors and styles.  The Teespring staff made all these changes for me behind the scenes—on a weekend.  The site’s limitations still necessitated the creation of two separate t-shirt “campaigns” for the two different ink colors used on the <a href=\"http://teespring.com/hypercritical-dark\">dark</a> and <a href=\"http://teespring.com/hypercritical\">light</a> shirts.</p>\n\n<p>If you follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/hypercritical\">@hypercritical</a> or <a href=\"http://twitter.com/siracusa\">@siracusa</a> on Twitter and were online this weekend, this is all probably old news to you.  My dual t-shirt sales have already far surpassed their goals, thanks to the amazing response of my Twitter followers.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like to support my writing on this site, the t-shirt sale will continue until May 14th.  According to <a href=\"http://teespring.com/about/shipping\">Teespring's shipping estimates</a>, all orders should arrive by June 4th at the latest, including international orders.

In these videos, his message has been remarkably consistent.</p><p>Ive demands that the hardware be true to itself—its purpose, its materials, the way it looks, and the way it feels.  Here’s a quote from one of Ive’s rare  outside an Apple press event, talking about hardware design at Apple.<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdVG4LcoY4Y&amp;t=81\">appearances</a></p><p>Steve Jobs also subscribed to this philosophy.

While Jobs was  a champion of , Ive could only wince when .<a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670760/will-apples-tacky-software-design-philosophy-cause-a-revolt\">reportedly</a><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7/5/#ical\">rich Corinthian leather</a><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/9283706/Jonathan-Ive-interview-simplicity-isnt-simple.html\">asked about it in an interview</a></p><p>I’m confident that we’ll see less leather, wood, felt, and  in Apple’s future software products, but the question remains: what does it mean for an application or an OS to be true to itself?<a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/apple/2013/03/21/apple-updates-podcasts-app-with-custom-stations-on-the-go-playlists-and-less-skeuomorphic-design/\">animated reel-to-reel tapes</a></p><p>I’m not sure how Ive will express that concept, but , creator of  and , offers one possible interpretation on  (starting at 6:10, and again at 1:02:26, specifically mentioning Ive).  Letterpress is an exemplar of the so-called “” aesthetic (and it’s also currently featured on ).  Brichter designed the look and feel of Letterpress based on the things that modern graphics hardware is naturally good at doing: drawing and manipulating flat planes of mostly solid colors.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lorenb\">Loren Brichter</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweetie\">Tweetie</a><a href=\"http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/\">Letterpress</a><a href=\"http://www.imore.com/loren-brichter-talks-opengl-tweetie-letterpress-and-future-interface\">an episode of the Debug podcast</a><a href=\"http://pinterest.com/warmarc/flat-ui-design/\">flat design</a><a href=\"http://www.apple.com\">the front page of Apple.com</a></p><p>A design philosophy so tightly linked to nitty-gritty details of silicon chips and OpenGL APIs is unlikely to resonate with Ive as much as it does with a programmer like Brichter, but the end results may be similar.  I expect Ive to focus on harmony between the look and feel of the software, the materials and finish of the hardware, and most importantly, the intended purpose of each specific application.  (It’s kind of a shame that Apple’s  the “Harmony” code name.)  This is my message to Jony Ive and my hope for iOS 7, OS X 10.9, and each bundled application: to thine own self be true.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_7.6#Mac_OS_7.6\">already used</a></p><blockquote><p>When we’re designing a product, we have to look to different attributes of the product. Some of those attributes will be the materials that it’s made from and the form that’s connected to those materials.  So for example, with the first iMac that we made, the primary component of that was the cathode ray tube, which was spherical. We would have an entirely different approach to designing something like that than the current iMac, which is a very thin, flat-panel display. […]</p><p>A lot of what we seem to be doing in a product like [the iPhone] is actually getting design out of the way. And I think when forms develop with that sort of reason, and they’re not just arbitrary shapes, it feels almost inevitable. It feels almost undesigned. It feels almost like, well, of course it’s that way. You know, why wouldn’t it be any other way?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The big ideas was, that rather than glom these things all together and ruin them all—a lower-performance computer and a flat screen that isn’t flat anymore—why don’t we let each element be true to itself?  If the screen is flat, let it be flat.  If the computer wants to be horizontal, let it be horizontal.</p></blockquote></div></div>",

I wanted to preserve at least some aspect of the process that rewarded the most enthusiastic Apple fans: the people who are willing to be roused from bed at 2 a.m. and rush to their computers to buy tickets; ; the people who just want it more.<a href=\"http://atp.fm/episodes/10-gradual-ramp-up-to-nothing\">recent podcast</a><a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/\">WWDC</a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX9GTUMh490\">the crazy ones</a></p><p>After yesterday’s experience of watching WWDC tickets sell out in what I measured to be less than 2 minutes, I’ve changed my mind.  If the tickets had sold out in, say, 10 minutes (and assuming no server errors—more on that in a moment), then dedicated buyers would have been rewarded.  If you couldn’t be bothered to be online until more than 10 minutes after the tickets went on sale, well, tough luck.  Someone else wanted it more.</p><p>But tickets selling out in less than 2 minutes does not reward anyone’s dedication.  We were all online at 10 a.m. PDT sharp, all ready to purchase, all equally dedicated.  It was a de facto lottery, with an extra layer of pointless stress added on top.</p><p>Apple’s servers performed admirably…for about the first 5 seconds after tickets went on sale.  After that, it was a crapshoot.  Even if the tickets had sold out in an hour, it’d still effectively be a lottery if that hour was filled with server errors.  You’d “win” if you happened to get through the purchase process with no errors.</p><p>An actual lottery, pre-announced, with no time pressure for entry, would be more equitable than what happened yesterday.  That’s what I recommend for next year.</p><p>Many more people want to attend WWDC than the conference can accommodate.  There has been no shortage of  for how to fix this.  Broadly speaking, WWDC has not changed in decades. Apple and its developer ecosystem, on the other hand, are radically different than they were just five years ago.  Something has to give.<a href=\"http://bitsplitting.org/2013/04/25/end-wwdc/\">interesting suggestions</a></p><p>I’ve heard many non-developers discuss the rush to get WWDC tickets as if the big draw is the keynote presentation, where Apple typically reveals new products.  That is the most interesting part of the conference for the public, but it’s not why WWDC sells out so fast.</p><p>Developers flock to WWDC because it’s a rare opportunity to communicate with Apple directly, human to human.  The best way to decrease the demand for WWDC tickets is for Apple to increase its communication with developers throughout the year.  And by communication I don’t mean throwing documentation or even video presentations over the wall to developers; I mean staffing up for more real, personal, timely,  contact with developers outside the court-like atmosphere of the App Store review process or the artificial scarcity of .<i>informal</i><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/technical/submit/\">Technical Support Incidents</a></p><p>Apple’s decision to release WWDC session videos to all registered developers during the conference was long overdue, but it clearly didn’t decrease demand for WWDC tickets enough to make a difference.  Maybe next year, after developers have experienced their first  WWDC, it will make a dent.  But I really believe that increased, improved communication between Apple and developers on all fronts is the best long-term solution.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_delay\">tape-delayed</a></p><h2>The Heart of the Matter</h2></div></div>",

Apple didn’t merely “adopt” this technology; it took the source code and ran with it, hiring a bunch of smart, experienced developers and giving them the time and resources they needed to massively improve KHTML/KJS over the course of several years.  Thus, .<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHTML\">KHTML</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KJS_(KDE)\">KJS</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE\">KDE</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webkit#Origins\">WebKit was born</a></p><p>In the world of open source software, this is the only legitimate way to assert “ownership” of a project: become the driving force behind the development process by contributing the most—and the best—changes.

Rather than  its own engine based on WebKit, Google chose to participate in the existing WebKit community.  At the time, Apple was clearly the big dog in the WebKit world.

It turned out to be the latter.  Thus, .<a href=\"http://www.chromium.org/blink\">Blink was born</a></p><p>Google has  that it has the talent, experience, and resources to develop a world-class web browser.

All the code in question is , so Apple is free to pull improvements from Blink into WebKit.  Of course, Google has little motivation to help with this effort.  Furthermore, Blink is a clearly declared fork that’s likely to rapidly diverge from its WebKit origins.  From : “[W]e anticipate that we’ll be able to remove 7 build systems and delete more than 7,000 files—comprising more than 4.5 million lines—right off the bat.”  (There’s  in the works on the other side of the fence too.)<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source\">open-source</a><a href=\"http://blog.chromium.org/2013/04/blink-rendering-engine-for-chromium.html\">Google’s press release about Blink</a><a href=\"https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2013-April/024388.html\">some streamlining</a></p><p>Does Apple—and the rest of the WebKit community—have the skill and capacity to continue to drive WebKit forward at a pace that matches ?  The easy answer is, “Of course it does!

Google  its multi-process architecture back to the WebKit project, so Apple created its own solution: the somewhat confusingly named .  While Google chose to put the process management into the browser application, Apple baked multi-process support into the WebKit engine itself.  This means that any application that uses WebKit2 gets the benefits of multi-process isolation without having to do anything special.<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5490242\">did not want to contribute</a><a href=\"http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKit2\">WebKit2</a></p><p>This all sounds great on paper, but in (several years of) practice, Google’s Chrome has proven to be far more stable and resilient in the face of misbehaving web pages than Apple’s WebKit2-based Safari.

Only a handful of companies in history have done it successfully on a large scale—and Samsung’s not one of them.  Sure, it’s possible to staff-up and build that expertise, but it’s not easy and it requires years of commitment.  I’d bet against Samsung pulling it off.</p><p> can also be viewed through the lens of developer-based self reliance.  Facebook clearly wants to make sure it’s an important part of the future of mobile computing, but that’s not easy to do when you’re “just a website.”  Home lets Facebook put itself front and center on existing Android-based smartphones.<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/home\">Facebook Home</a></p><p>It seems unwise for Facebook to build its mobile strategy on the back of a platform controlled by its mortal enemy, Google.  But perhaps Home is just the first step of a long-term plan that will eventually lead to a Facebook fork of Android.  If so, the question inevitably follows: can Facebook really take ownership of its own platform without help from Google?</p><p>Facebook has proven that it can expand its skill set.  Over the past few years, it’s been hiring  and acquiring  with proven design chops.  Facebook Home is the first result of those efforts, and by all accounts, the user interface exhibits a level of polish more commonly associated with Apple than Facebook.<a href=\"http://www.mikematas.com\">talented designers</a><a href=\"http://www.madebysofa.com\">companies</a></p><p>Still, a lock screen replacement is a far cry from a full OS.

Facebook Home has been cited as an example of Google’s ineffectualness.  Look at how one of Google’s fiercest enemies has played it for a fool, they say.  Google did all the hard work, then Facebook came in at the last minute and co-opted it all for its own purposes.</p><p>But look again at the  above.  Now imagine similar graphs for the Android source code.  Any company with Android-based products that wants to be truly free from Google’s control has to be prepared—and able—to match Google’s output.  Operating systems don’t write themselves; platforms don’t maintain themselves; developers need tools and support; technology marches on.  It’s not enough just to just fix bugs and support new hardware.  To succeed with an Android fork, a company has to drive development in the same way that Apple did when it spawned WebKit from KHTML, just as Google is doing as it forks Blink from WebKit.<a href=\"#graphs\">graphs</a></p><p>This is not a .  Companies like Samsung and Facebook can’t just mine for more resources and build new developer .

What’s not so clear is which company is best positioned to thrive in that future.</p>\n\n<p>For smartphones in particular, the traditional metrics are confusing.  Android has <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2013/02/13/android-solidifies-smartphone-market-share/\">70% market share</a>, but Apple is taking <a href=\"http://www.asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-03-at-5-3-10.33.31-AM.png\">70% of the profit</a>.  Google, meanwhile, is not benefiting from Android’s market share dominance as much as Samsung, which recorded <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Vqbt1Vyk7OgJ:online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324039504578262432246509020.html+http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324039504578262432246509020.html&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\">$4 billion in profit</a> from its cellphone and telecom business in Q4 2012.  In the same quarter, Google made less—<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/01/22/google-facebook-zynga-motorola/1855185/\">$2.89 billion</a>—from all its businesses combined.  And when it comes to selling actual smartphones, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2013/02/06/applesamsung-101-of-q4-handset-profits-103-for-2012/\">the only two companies making <i>any</i> money</a> are Apple and Samsung.</p>\n\n<p>So who’s winning?  When pondering this, I find myself thinking about dependencies.  What is each company doing for itself, and in what ways does each company rely on others?  I think this balance, much more than profits or market share, is what will determine long-term success.  Let’s see how the players stack up.</p>\n\n<h2>Google: Mini-Microsoft</h2>\n\n<p>Google’s Android strategy looks a lot like Microsoft’s Windows strategy of yore—minus the part where you collect all the money.  Google got the other parts right, though: create a viable platform, support it, evangelize it, and get as many other companies as possible to use it.  That last part is made a lot easier when the OS is free and open source, of course.</p>\n\n<p>In the PC’s heyday, Compaq, Dell, HP, Gateway, and others all killed each other selling PC hardware, grinding their profit margins down to almost nothing, leaving only a few players (<a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130205/dell-confirms-plan-to-go-private-in-24-4-billion-buyout-deal/\">barely</a>) standing in the end.  Microsoft, meanwhile, sat back and collected the same fat software margins from all of them (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office\">and</a> from nearly all of their customers, as well).</p>\n\n<p>With Android, Google seemed to posit that there was value inherent in being the platform “owner,” even if hardware makers didn’t pay for each copy of the OS.  Android was filled with connections to Google’s (also free) services.  More people using Android meant more people seeing Google ads, which meant more money for Google.</p>\n\n<p>In the early days of Android, this theory looked promising.  As in the PC era, hardware makers jockeyed for position in the nascent Android market.  Individual fortunes rose and fell, but the number of Android activations <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/311884391464988672\">just kept growing</a>.  So far, so good.</p>\n\n<p>But unlike the early PC market, the Android market hasn’t produced a group of strong competitors duking it out at the top.  As previously noted, only one company, Samsung, is making any money at all selling Android smartphones—and it’s making more from them than Google itself.</p>\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_One\">beginning</a>, Google has shrewdly hedged its bets by fielding <a href=\"http://www.google.com/nexus/\">its own line of Android hardware</a>.  More recently, Google <a href=\"http://www.google.com/press/motorola/\">purchased Motorola</a>, giving it its very own bona fide handset maker.  Thus far, none of these efforts have produced Samsung-like numbers.  But it’s clear that Google is unwilling to be entirely dependent on other companies to create the hardware that its mobile OS needs to be a complete product.</p>\n\n<h2>Samsung: Death From Below</h2>\n\n<p>Samsung seems like an Android success story.  Previously better known in the US for its TVs than its smartphones, Samsung combined its hardware manufacturing prowess (and its <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/83\">shameless</a> willingness to <a href=\"http://samsungcopiesapple.tumblr.com\">copy other companies’</a> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/samsung/9932372/Seen-it-before-Samsungs-game-controller-looks-familiar.html\">design cues</a>) with Google’s mobile OS to produce profitable phones that customers love.</p>\n\n<p>Though the Galaxy line of devices would not be possible without Android, Samsung is far from Google’s ideal of a dutiful Android licensee, selflessly ferrying customers to Google’s services.</p>\n\n<p>Just as PC makers used to insist on adding their own graphical shell or other brand-specific “enhancements” to their Windows PCs, most companies selling Android-based hardware products feel compelled to put their own stamp on the vanilla Android experience.  Samsung is no different, steadily papering over the underlying Android OS with each new release of its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TouchWiz\">TouchWiz</a> user interface.</p>\n\n<p>And why not?  If Android is a money-loser for every other smartphone maker, Samsung is obviously doing something right.  In its recent <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-31322_3-57574466-256/samsung-gs4-launch-tone-deaf-and-shockingly-sexist/\">ill-conceived</a> Galaxy S4 launch event, <a href=\"http://www.techhive.com/article/2030981/samsung-puts-galaxy-not-android-on-center-stage.html\">Android was barely mentioned at all</a>.  Samsung’s dependence on Android is clearly chafing.\n\n<h2>Apple: Once Bitten, Twice Shy</h2>\n\n<p>In truth, Apple has been bitten more than once by its dependence on other companies.  The viability of the Mac once depended on Microsoft’s willingness to produce a decent version of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office\">Office</a> for it. Later, the Mac faltered multiple times when IBM and Motorola were unwilling or unable to produce competitive desktop and laptop CPUs.  When Apple wanted to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhapsody_(operating_system)\">revamp its OS</a>, Adobe and Microsoft were unwilling to port their software, forcing Apple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X\">back to the drawing board</a>.  Then there was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWSRgsk2oaw&amp;t=3m10s\">that time</a> when Apple asked another company to make a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Rokr#E1\">phone</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Like a lover who’s been betrayed one too many times, Apple has hardened its corporate heart against any form of true partnership.  If it’s important, Apple wants to own and control it.  When Apple does work with others, it insists on having the upper hand.  iOS developers serve at the pleasure of Apple.  Manufacturing partners must fight for the privilege of building Apple’s products, often using equipment Apple purchases for them.  And, of course, Apple has its own mobile OS that runs exclusively on its own hardware.  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn26pEDEhyY\">As God is its witness, Apple will never be hungry again!</a></p>\n\n<p>Steve Jobs personified this attitude, which is why he felt <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2011/10/21/steve-jobs-vowed-to-destroy-android/\">so deeply betrayed</a> when Google, his partner on stage during <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxua7EDRdo&amp;t=51\">the iPhone introduction</a>, remade Android in iOS’s image.  After that, Apple’s reliance on Google for essential parts of its mobile experience simply could not stand.</p>\n\n<p>The trouble is, online services have <a href=\"http://createlivelove.com/246\">not</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MobileMe\">historically</a> been Apple’s strength.  That’s why it partnered with Google, Yahoo, and others in the first place.  It took Apple several years (<a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2009-10/02/analysis-apple-buys-placebase-hinting-at-split-with-google\">and</a> <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2010/07/14/apple-acquires-poly9-mapping-company/\">several</a> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/10/apple-now-has-third-piece-of-mapping-puzzle-but-whats-the-full-picture/\">acquisitions</a>) to finally replace Google maps—and the <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/11/apple-fires-manager-of-maps-team/\">results</a> were not ideal.</p>\n\n<p>There’s an old saying in business: don’t outsource your core competency.  Or, <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000007.html\">as Joel Spolsky originally put it</a>, “If it’s a core business function, do it yourself, no matter what.”  This guideline makes it easy for a software developer to decide to outsource, say, catering and landscaping services.  But what about Apple, with its historically well-founded paranoia about relying on outside companies for anything related to its actual products?  What happens when everything starts to look like a “core business function?”</p>\n\n<h2>Sometimes You Can’t Make It on Your Own</h2>\n\n<p>Even among just these three companies, there are more than enough dependencies to go around.  Google depends on other companies to make and sell the vast majority of the products that run its mobile OS.  Samsung depends on Google to make and support the most important software component of its flagship mobile devices.  Even the fiercely independent Apple still depends on Samsung to manufacture many of its mobile processors (<a href=\"http://www.imore.com/apple-may-say-goodbye-samsung-quad-core-chips\">for now…</a>) and Google to provide web search services—and perhaps to give <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/12/google-maps-for-iphone-shows-apple-how-to-do-mapping-right/\">a little help with maps</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the original question: who has the upper hand?  Yes, there are  dependencies in all directions—but not all dependencies are created equal.</p>\n\n<p>Despite its recent success, Samsung remains in the weakest position.  It clearly doesn’t want to remain beholden to Google, and that’s the right instinct.  But I’m not confident in Samsung’s ability to completely divorce its mobile platform from Android.  I just don’t think it has the experience or expertise to be a real platform owner.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, while Android’s market share may be overwhelming, Samsung’s is not.  Even if Samsung had the skills to take the reins of its software stack, it’d have to maintain compatibility with present and future versions of Android, lest it become just another low-volume also-ran smartphone platform.</p>\n\n<p>Google’s present position looks weak, but it has two big trump cards.  First, Google has proven to be one of the few companies capable of creating, popularizing, and supporting a platform.  Despite all the skinning and branding by handset makers, Google is still the driving force behind Android.  This power can only be negated by another company that’s willing and able to match Google’s Android efforts on all fronts: OS development, app store, developer tools, evangelism, the works.  That’s a tall order.</p>\n\n<p>Second, Google is still the king of online services.  Apple, the biggest technology company in the world, just tried to replace maps, one of Google’s second-tier services, and barely avoided disaster.  Microsoft, the former undisputed ruler of the tech sector, has been <a href=\"http://www.bing.com\">trying</a> for years to challenge Google for the web-search crown, with little success.  Maps and search are not obscure or obsolete services.  If you can’t create equal or better alternatives—and so far, no one has—then you’re stuck relying on Google.</p>\n\n<p>Google still needs hardware partners to maintain its Android empire, but we already have a model for how a software-focused platform owner can dominate a market.  It’s harder to imagine a hardware maker dominating while relying on a software platform controlled by someone else.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there’s Apple, the jilted lover, feverishly working to eliminate any dependency that puts it at the mercy of a potential competitor.  Apple remembers when Samsung was a great source of mobile CPUs and Google provided network services for iOS.  Now look at those two traitors.  No partnership is safe!</p>\n\n<p>And so, in addition to developing its own OS, designing its own hardware, producing many of its most popular applications (built in its own IDE using its own compiler and language), Apple now has its own mapping service, is designing its own mobile CPUs, and is trying to get someone other than Samsung to manufacture them—all the while presumably eyeing its other parts suppliers and software partners warily.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the bumps, Apple’s position remains strong.  It’s got the best app ecosystem, competitive, trend-setting hardware, great adoption of each new version of its OS, and double the margins of the only other company making money selling smartphones.  Oh yeah, and it dominates the tablet market too.  There’s a lot for <a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/2013/02/02/apples-2013-to-do-list\">Apple to do in 2013</a>, but at least it’s poised to succeed or fail on its own merits.</p>\n\n<p>Looking out further than a year, the picture gets fuzzier.  An unfortunate side effect of doing everything yourself is that every other company starts to look like an enemy.  Realistically, Apple can’t do everything—or can’t do everything well, anyway.  Online services are only going to become more important with time, so it’s understandable that Apple wants to be the master of its own destiny in this area.  But it needs to improve much more quickly if it wants to even remain competitive, let alone catch up to Google.  Failing that, it needs to find some partners that aren’t mortal enemies.  (I’m sure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marissa_Mayer\">Marissa Mayer</a> would take Tim Cook’s call.)</p>\n\n<p>In general, Apple needs to engage in more balanced partnerships that produce sustainable benefits on both sides.  The switch to Intel CPUs is a good example, especially given how the situation has changed since the deal was first struck.  In business, no strategic partnership is forever, but that’s no reason to avoid them entirely.  And who knows?  Perhaps Apple’s good relations with Intel will lead to its next great mobile <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip\">SoC</a> being manufactured at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_nanometer\">22</a> or even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14_nanometer\">14nm</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s just hope <a href=\"http://software.intel.com/en-us/appup/tizen\">Tizen</a> doesn’t come up during the meeting.</p>",

If Apple produces a new Mac that’s faster than any of its current models by leaps and bounds, will people suddenly buy it in huge numbers, choosing it over the laptops, tablets, and phones they prefer today? No. Is it because a very fast Mac can be sold for such a high price that its huge margins will make its profits significant, despite the expected low number of sales? No, that won’t happen either.  Is a new, insanely fast Mac even guaranteed to make any money at all for Apple?  Sadly, no.</p><p>So why bother creating a true Mac Pro successor at all? Good riddance, right?</p><p>In the automobile industry, there’s what’s known as a “.”  Though you may not know the term, you surely know a few examples.

The same goes for GM buyers and the Corvette.  These cars are expensive to develop and maintain.  Due to the low sales volumes, most halo cars do not make money for car makers.  When Chrysler was recovering from bankruptcy in 2010, it considered selling the Viper product line.</p><p>Why wouldn’t a company want to get a low-volume, money-losing product line off its books, bankruptcy or no bankruptcy?  If you can’t think of a reason, you may be what is known in the auto industry as a “.”  Luckily for Viper fans, Chrysler had a few car guys left.  Here’s a passage from —the Viper that almost didn’t exist.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IYJEA6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004IYJEA6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=siracusa-20\">bean counter</a><a href=\"http://www.caranddriver.com/features/2013-srt-viper-gts-in-depth-with-the-men-who-made-it-happen-feature\">Car and Driver’s preview of the 2013 SRT Viper</a></p><p>The car guys won; Chrysler chose to keep the Viper.</p><p>Apple is not  in bankruptcy, but every other reason that Chrysler should have run screaming from the Viper applies equally to the Mac Pro (except perhaps the lack of profitability; Apple doesn’t share that information about individual Mac lines).  To understand Chrysler’s decision, let’s consider why halo cars exist at all.<a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/04/ben-bejarin\">yet</a></p><p>One reason is prestige.  Though few people can afford to buy a Viper, its mere existence makes the affordable cars from the same manufacturer that have even  slightly more attractive to buyers.  Yes, this makes little logical sense, but it’s a very real phenomenon.  (There’s a reason the term “halo effect”  dates back to at least 1938.)<a href=\"http://www.dodge.com/en/2013/avenger/\">the mildest bit of sporting pretension</a><a href=\"http://www.waywordradio.org/halo_car/\">reportedly</a></p><p>Halo cars also push car makers to their limits.  Engineering teams must use all their powers and all their skills to create the very best car possible.  This exercise inevitably leads to the exploration of new technologies.  The failed experiments are forgotten, but the winners eventually find their way into more prosaic cars from the same manufacturer.</p><p>The Mac Pro is Apple’s halo car.  It’s a chance for Apple to make the fastest, most powerful computer it can, besting its own past efforts and the efforts of its competitors, year after year.  This is Apple’s space program, its moonshot.  It’s a venue for new technologies to be explored.</p><p>Consider , Intel’s project to create a massively multi-core x86-based GPU.  Rumor has it that Apple was working on integrating the technology into a Mac Pro.  Intel eventually scuttled the project, but consider what would have happened if it had taken off, reshaping the GPU market in the process.  Apple would have had a head start on integrating the technology into its OS and application frameworks.  Its drivers would have had their kinks worked out.  When it became feasible to incorporate Larrabee technology into the rest of its product line, Apple would have been ready.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larrabee_(microarchitecture)\">Larrabee</a></p><p>I intentionally chose a (rumored) failure as an example because that’s part of the point.

(And that factor gets quite a bit larger if I add  to the mix.)  Computers are not “fast enough.”  They weren’t when they were invented, nor when they got 10x faster, nor when they got 100,000x faster still.

These days, it’s surprising if a startup creates a hardware product sophisticated enough to need an operating system and that operating system  Linux.  And let’s not forget that Linux has all but wiped out the proprietary Unix-based operating systems that once ruled the high-end.<i>isn’t</i></p><p>Linux is the canonical open source success story.  It succeeded for reasons that are now so boring they’re accepted as common sense.  There’s still plenty of room for variation and innovation, but now all the significant achievements are shared with the world.  If a company improves Linux, it’s not just improving its own products; it’s making Linux better for everyone.  Linux let us “put all the wood behind one arrowhead” (to borrow one of  favorite sayings), but on a global—instead of merely a corporate—scale.  (Funny how things turn out, eh, Scott?)  Linux solved the Unix problem—for everyone.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McNealy\">Scott McNealy’s</a></p><p>WebKit fills a similar role.  Thanks to WebKit, anyone who needs a world-class web rendering engine can get one—for free.  And the products built with WebKit are as varied as those built with Linux.  Even products in the same category vary wildly.  Chrome and Safari, for example, have different features, different extension mechanisms, different JavaScript engines, different process models, and very different user interfaces.  Opera adds yet more variation.  And these are all just standalone web browsers.  Consider all the embedded applications of WebKit, from game consoles to theme-park kiosks, and the idea of a homogenous, stagnating WebKit monoculture seems even more unlikely.<a name=\"webkit-variety\"/></p><p>I haven’t forgotten the past.  A single, crappy web browser coming to dominate the market would be just as terrible today as it was in the dark days of .  But WebKit is not a browser.  Like Linux, it’s an enabling technology.  Like Linux, it’s free, open-source, and therefore beyond the control of any single entity.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ie6\">IE6</a></p><p>Web rendering engines are extremely complex.  There are very few companies that have the expertise to create and maintain one on their own.  (Again, the similarity to Linux is strong here.)  I’m glad all those developers at Apple and Google are working on improving the same open-source web rendering engine, rather than dividing their efforts between two totally different, proprietary engines.  Adding Opera’s developers can only make things better.  The proliferation of WebKit will be a rising tide that lifts all boats.</p></div></div>",

A TV series like House of Cards that’s released a season at a time naturally lends itself to multi-episode viewing sessions.

Six years is an eternity in the world of technology.  For the first few decades of console gaming, each new hardware platform surpassed the capabilities of its predecessor by leaps and bounds.  There was little question about what to do with technology.  More, better, faster was an end in and of itself.  If you build it, the games will come.<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/02/sony-reveals-the-first-official-details-of-the-playstation-4/\">newly announced</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">PlayStation 3</a></p><p>The  was the first console to break that cycle, directing a large chunk of its innovation toward a novel control scheme, sacrificing raw computing power to do so.  .

While the PS4 will indeed be substantially more powerful than the PS3 (and embarrassingly more powerful than its competitor from Nintendo, the ), Sony has not chosen to sink millions into developing a radical new CPU architecture like the PS3’s  in the hopes that  will inexorably lead to market dominance.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U\">Wii U</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(microprocessor)\">Cell processor</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_instructions_per_second#Million_instructions_per_second\">raw MIPs</a></p><p>Instead, Sony has built the PS4 using a .  All the time, money, and energy that would have otherwise gone toward a true Cell successor has been refocused on ensuring that the PS4 does things that makes Sony’s customers happy.<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/02/inside-the-playstation-4-a-balanced-approach-to-building-a-game-console/\">nicely balanced arrangement of existing technology</a></p><p>Game developers are one kind of customer.  There may not be many of them relative to the number of people Sony hopes will buy its products at retail, but developers can make or break a game console by choosing which games to develop for which platform, and when.  And developers sure weren’t happy with the PS3, which was unlike any piece of gaming hardware that had come before it.  Thanks to its familiar combination of an  and an , the PS4 will be much easier to write games for.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86\">x86 CPU</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Islands_(GPU_family)\">ATI GPU</a></p><p>Sony feels gamers’ pain as well.  The PS4 appears to have been designed by identifying the parts of the PS3 experience that are annoying and deploying technology to eliminate them.  Deciding to play a game and being delayed by 30 minutes of mandatory system updates is not fun, so Sony added a dedicated processor to handle background downloads, and a low-power state for the entire system to allow this to happen unattended.  Resuming an interrupted gaming session only to find yourself back at the last checkpoint in the game is not fun, so Sony promises the ability to suspend a game’s state in its entirety and resume later at the instant you left off.  Waiting an hour for a multi-gigabyte game to download before you can start playing it is not fun, so the PS4 will allow games to be played as they download.</p><p>Sony is providing new features as well.  A dedicated video encoder allows gameplay to be recorded in real time with no loss of performance, and a “share” button on the controller allows that video to be uploaded (in the background, naturally), without leaving the game.  That same video encoding hardware plus Sony’s game-focused social network will allow players to invite their friends to watch them play in real time.  Sony even promises the ability to play games remotely.  If a player is having trouble with some part of a game, he could invite one of his friends to remotely assume control for a bit to help out.</p><p>Now, anyone who remembers Sony’s promises about the PlayStation 3 knows all too well how far they can be from the eventual reality.  I’m very skeptical about Sony’s ability to deliver all the announced PlayStation 4 capabilities in a competent and timely manner.  And then there are all the areas where the interests of gamers and game developers may conflict (e.g., ).<a href=\"http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/think-the-ps4-wil-be-best-friends-with-used-games-not-so-fast\">the market for used games</a></p><p>But when I look at the PlayStation 4 hardware itself, I see a shrewd acknowledgement of the true nature of innovation.  It doesn’t cost much to add dedicated silicon to handle background network transfers and video encoding and decoding, and it sure isn’t sexy, technologically speaking.  Low-power sleep states, instant suspend/resume, progressive downloads, and remote play are all features that are a giant pain to implement and do precisely nothing to make games look, sound, or perform better.  But it’s these things, not the number of CPU/GPU cores or the amount of RAM, that really have a chance of making the PS4 gaming experience stand head and shoulders above what has come before.</p><p>We nerds love technology for its own sake.  Indeed, there’s  by advancing the state of the art and providing more of a good thing.  But the most profound leaps are often the result of applying technology to historically underserved areas.  By all means, make everything better and faster, but also find the things that seem like minor annoyances, the things that everyone just accepts as necessary evils.  Go after  things and you’ll really make people love you.  Accentuate the positive.   the negative.<a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/2013/02/08/dont-stop-thinking-about-tomorrow\">always something to be gained</a><i>those</i><i>Eliminate</i></p></div></div>",

      "content": "<p>The iPhone 5 <a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/136422-iphone-5-review-round-up-everything-apple-promised\">caught</a> <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/26/tech/mobile/iphone-5-complaints\">some</a> <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5945662/the-weirdest-thing-people-hate-about-the-iphone-5\">flak</a> for being “too light.”  Similarly, some consider the latest revision of the iMac to be “<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/12/review-21-5-inch-2012-imac-takes-two-steps-forward-one-step-back/\">too thin</a>.”  You’ll find some incredulity in the articles that address this topic.  It’s a little silly, right?  After all, what’s the alternative? Thicker and heavier?  Stagnation?  But these complaints are not entirely unreasonable.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to electronics, density is often a signal of quality.  A product that feels like an empty metal box seems cheap.  A tiny item with surprising heft seems expensive.  For handheld items, higher density can also help produce stronger, more concentrated pressure on the hand.  This helps to more clearly delineate the sensations of a securely held item and an item that’s about to slip out of the hand.  I’ve heard this complaint about the iPhone 5 many times: “It’s so light, I’m afraid I’m going to drop it!”</p>\n\n<p>No one is holding an iMac while using it, so there’s no fear of dropping it.  But if it’s not being held, why the rush to slim down?  Dissatisfaction with the <a href=\"/2013/02/08/images/thinning-imac.jpg\">ever-slimming iMac</a> is exacerbated by the removal of the optical drive in the latest revision.  In all likelihood, that optical drive was going away regardless of the thickness of the iMac’s edge.  (Apple’s been steadily dropping optical drives from the Mac line for years.)  Still, some people can’t help but infer a cause and effect relationship, blaming Apple’s seemingly pointless drive for thinness for the loss of the slot for the spinning shiny things.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, I’ve voiced my own complaints about <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/91\">the edge of the latest iMac</a> and <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/86\">how the iPhone 5 feels in the hand</a>.  But though I might disagree with the timing and details of these changes, I fully support the broader long-term trend towards lighter, thinner hardware.  Here’s why.</p>\n\n<p>In technology, things that can be measured appear to exist on a smooth continuum: large to small, slow to fast.  But the  experiences provided by these measurable quantities often have sharp discontinuities.</p>\n\n<p>Consider touch-screen user interfaces. They’ve existed for decades, but it wasn’t until the iPhone arrived that they entered widespread usage.  Yes, there are many non-tech factors that contributed to this, but the responsiveness of the iPhone’s interface was an essential factor.  With the iPhone, touch interfaces finally crossed the threshold from frustrating to joyful.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure where the threshold is, or even what quantities it applies to (e.g., frames-per-second of animation, input lag, finger pressure), but it’s definitely there.  It’s not a steady ramp from unacceptable to acceptable.  It’s a perceived discontinuity—a leap.</p>\n\n<p>Most measurable qualities of tech products have experiential discontinuities like this.  In fact, there are usually <i>multiple</i> discontinuities.  It’s human nature to think that we’re at the pinnacle of useful achievement, but it’s never actually true.  Watch what happens to the experience of using a touch-screen when we go in search of the next discontinuity—what the Microsoft researcher in this video calls “a perceptual cliff.\"\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vOvQCPLkPt4?start=52&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>This phenomenon is not limited to performance measurements.  It extends to every aspect of a product, including size, weight, and even shape.  Let’s reconsider the iPhone.  The change in thickness and weight between the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 5 was very small.  Using an iPhone 5 does not feel dramatically different than using a 4S.  Clearly, the iPhone 5 has not yet reached the next perceptual cliff—but it’s out there.</p>\n\n<p>Consider a distant-future iPhone roughly the same width and height as the iPhone 5, but as thin and as durable as a credit card.  Accidentally drop such a phone and it’d flutter harmlessly to the ground.  Now maybe this would be a terrible design—the edges might dig into your hand, and it might be even less secure-feeling when held—but it’d clearly change the equation when it comes to fear of dropping your iPhone (not to mention where and how to carry it, and so on).</p>\n\n<p>Don’t get distracted by the details.  I’m not arguing for or against a particular design.  My point is that it’s important to keep making progress towards the next discontinuity, wherever it may be.</p>\n\n<p>Apple has its compass trained on “thinner and lighter,” a direction that’s proven fruitful in the past.  But as much as we’d all like to jump right to the next big win, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer\">you can’t just skip to the end</a>.  The original iPhone was never going to be followed by the credit-card-thin iPhone—again, ignoring whether this is actually a good idea; stay with me!  Instead, it was followed by the 3G (thicker in the middle, but thinner-feeling on the edge), then the 4 (thinner overall), then the 5 (thinner still), and so on.</p>\n\n<p>The same goes for the iMac, with the same caveats about the direction and endpoint.  How does the iMac change as a product when it’s as thin as an iPad, or a cafeteria tray, or a credit card?  Does it even need to exist at that point?  Maybe the distant-future iMac is “just a big iPad.”  Or maybe some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Glass\">new i/o device</a> makes all of this moot.</p>\n\n<p>Mistakes will be made in the march towards the future.  But the worst possible mistake is neglecting to do the work required to get there because you think we’ve already arrived.  There is no destination; there is only the journey.  Pick a direction or get out of the way.</p>",

This is not a fantasy wish list.  These are things I think Apple can and should do this year.

Selling  from  at a discount is no longer good enough.  Apple can make more attractive phones at similar prices if they’re purpose-built using modern parts and processes.

I discussed this at length in  (the topic starts at 35:57), but here’s a summary: Artists are often .  Once an artistic creation reaches a certain level of cultural significance, it belongs to society at large more than it belongs to the creators—philosophically, if not legally.  Cultural touchstones belong to all of us, and they deserve to be treasured and preserved, regardless of the creator’s wishes.<a href=\"http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/45\">episode 45 of the Hypercritical podcast</a><a href=\"http://john-mccoy.blogspot.com/2011/09/bad-motivator.html\">not the best stewards of their own work</a></p><p>Video games are an odd art form in , one of which is that they’re extremely dependent on their delivery .  More established kinds of art like paintings, books, video, and audio recordings have all proven resilient to changes in technology.  The novels of Charles Dickens did not disappear as .  Most filmmakers have been vigilant about preserving and (eventually) digitizing movies that were shot on film.  (Again, .)  All these art forms have a clear path to move forward in time; they’ll always be with us.<a href=\"http://natebarham.com/post/22653350983/physical-skills-are-the-barrier-to-art\">many ways</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform\">platform</a><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2009/02/the-once-and-future-e-book/\">book technology evolved</a><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2010/05/star-wars/\">Star Wars stands out as a sad exception</a></p><p>Video games are a different story.  Historically, video game platform owners have been unwilling or unable to preserve the works of art originally delivered on their platforms.  When the Wii, , and  all launched with some ability to play games made for the consoles they replaced, I was optimistic about the future.  But the PS3’s ability to play  games rapidly diminished, first losing dedicated hardware support and then disappearing completely.  Similarly, the  can’t play GameCube games.  Hoarding and preserving console launch hardware started to make a lot more sense.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3\">PS3</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360\">Xbox 360</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2\">PS2</a><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/16/gamecube-free-wii-refresh-heads-to-north-america-competes-with/\">latest iteration of the Wii</a></p><p>Today, Nintendo sells .  Presumably this will extend to Wii U games when that hardware is eventually phased out.  But I have little faith in Nintendo’s motivation to preserve its past beyond its function as an income source.  And let’s not forget all the important video game makers that have gone out of business—or been acquired and re-acquired so many times that they might as well have.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Console\">its own emulated versions of many of its classic games</a></p><p>Again, , it has fallen to the fans to preserve classic games, sometimes by , but most often .  This doesn’t just apply to video games that are 30 years old.  Games are becoming inaccessible so rapidly that even platforms created just a handful of years ago already have .<a href=\"http://www.screened.com/news/behind-the-scenes-of-harmys-star-wars-despecialized-edition/2917/\">as in the case of Star Wars</a><a href=\"http://www.mattholden.com/consoles/\">preserving the original hardware</a><a href=\"http://mamedev.org\">through emulation</a><a href=\"https://dolphin-emu.org/\">active emulation projects</a></p><p>That’s the fear that HD remakes tap into.  Though there are many things that can go wrong when an older video game is ported and “improved” for release on a newer hardware platform, the risks are vastly outweighed in my mind by the playable-lifespan extension that a remake bestows on a beloved game.</p><p>Right now, I can play Wind Waker on my GameCube and my Wii.  Newer Wiis (and the Wii U) don’t play GameCube games.  Both the GameCube and the Wii send their video signal over a  cable, at best.  I suspect TVs will stop shipping with component video inputs in a few years, which will leave me at the mercy of video converter boxes.  Eventually, no matter how well I care for them, my 12-year-old GameCube and my 7-year-old Wii will break.  (The optical drives will probably go first.)  But when that happens, my Wii U, with its  connection and 2012 manufacture date, will probably still be working.  Time extended!<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_video\">component</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hdmi\">HDMI</a></p><p>Alas, things get even more complicated when you consider not just the software but also the controller hardware and the details of the display device.  I’ve still got my  in the attic, but my son experienced  by playing  on the Wii connected to a .  Was it the same as playing the original using an N64 controller and an old  television?  Well, not quite.  This problem only gets worse as .<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64\">N64</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time\">Ocarina of Time</a><a href=\"http://zeldawiki.org/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Collector's_Edition\">the GameCube port</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_display\">plasma HDTV</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube\">CRT</a><a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/3786\">the hardware gets more novel</a></p><p>In the end, I’m content to at least preserve the software in some playable form, even if the controller and display are slightly different.  Just doing this is turning out to be enough of a fight.  I hope my purchase of the Wii U remake of Wind Waker will help convince Nintendo and other game makers that older titles are valued by gamers long past the death of their original platforms.</p><p>I’m also a little afraid that remakes like this will delay or prevent the original version of the game from appearing in an officially sanctioned emulated form.  But for now, I’ll take what I can get.  I’m glad my son has already played the original GameCube version of Wind Waker—twice.  I’m also excited to replay Wind Waker with him on the Wii U in HD.  It won’t be exactly the same as it was, but I think it’ll still be great.  Most importantly, I hope he can share both of these experiences with his children someday.</p></div></div>",

The obvious solution is to .  If only.  I have little faith that these companies are willing and able to transform themselves in the radical ways required to produce and support great software.  Here’s what I see happening instead.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMOP\">just make better software</a></p><p>The long-term success of these companies now hinges on how difficult it is to create the hardware product that’s wrapped around their crappy software.  Car makers, for example, are probably safe from software upstarts (if not from other car makers).  The barrier to entry in the auto industry is immense, and the remaining successful car makers have deep expertise in their craft.  If  succeeds, for example, it won’t be because  is slow and unintuitive.<a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com\">Tesla</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyFord_Touch\">MyFord Touch</a></p><p>TV makers, on the other hand, should be worried.  Most of the hardware they make is already a component of the industries dominated by the software guys.  The proliferation of “smart” TV features is fueled by the fear of becoming a mere component supplier.  Unfortunately for the companies involved, the terrible quality of these features may actually end up hastening the transitions from “TV maker” to “panel maker.”</p><p>At this point, the only thing keeping the hounds at bay is the reality that a TV with non-crappy software requires a much deeper cooperation with content providers.  So while Apple can whip up a TV running iOS in its sleep, giving that software something useful to do requires talking to content owners—and possibly also cable companies and ISPs, who are even more keen to keep the content owners in their camp, and who have  to  that the auto industry would die for.  And this is before even considering the fragmentation of TV and Internet access in the US and around the world.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x\">barriers</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_site\">entry</a></p><p>The hardware barriers that protect ISPs and car makers will probably hold up (much to our detriment, in the case of US ISPs), but I think the TV content owners will eventually come around—or be .  When that happens, the market for formerly “software-neutral” hardware devices like TVs will rapidly follow the same path as the mobile phone market.  If it happens soon enough, it may even be the same familiar handful of companies that gobble up all the losers: Apple, Samsung, Google, maybe even Microsoft.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(U.S._TV_series)\">routed around</a></p><p>Until then, we’ll all just have to suffer through—or find a way to ignore—this avalanche of software that’s slowly making our a/v equipment, appliances, and vehicles more annoying to use.</p></div></div>",

I’m going to use it to illustrate a larger point about technology, and in doing so, I’m going to spoil the game.  If you have any interest in video games at all, I strongly recommend that you do not read any further until you’ve played it.<a href=\"http://thatgamecompany.com/games/journey/\">Journey</a></p><p>Online discourse can be harsh.  Nowhere is this more true than in multiplayer video games.  It’s nearly impossible to play a popular online game without being exposed to — or worse, being the target of — the most vile kinds of  and insults, including sexist, racist, and homophobic slurs.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Griefing\">behaviors</a></p><p>This problem is not confined to video games. Even something as seemingly benign as a comment form on a popular technology blog can trigger profoundly bad behavior. A well-known Penny Arcade comic sums up the phenomenon nicely in the form of , which states: Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total Fuckwad.<a href=\"http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19/\">John Gabriel’s Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory</a></p><p>Many remedies have been tried: moderation, the use of “real names” (whatever that means), increasingly complex privacy settings, user voting, karma scores, etc.  Sometimes these things help, but often only a little — and they all require constant vigilance.</p><p>In frustration, many users and content creators choose to take out the big hammer and end discourse entirely.  . Mute all voice chat. Disable communication between players on opposing teams.  .<a href=\"http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/29/comments-off/\">Eliminate blog comments</a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo\">The only winning move is not to play</a></p><p>So goes the conventional wisdom.  But then there’s Journey, a $15 video game for the PlayStation 3.  When you start playing Journey, it’s not even obvious that it’s a multiplayer game.  When other players appear, they are not announced in any way, nor are you directed to interact with them.  Some players choose to ignore them and complete the game on their own.  Others dismiss them as computer-controlled .  This is the first part of Journey’s solution: interaction with others is optional.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character\">NPCs</a></p><p>Those who choose to engage with others have only a few choices.  Players can move, jump, and “sing” by pressing a single button, causing a musical note to play and a unique glyph to appear on screen.  The glyph is not selected or drawn by the player; it’s automatically chosen by the game (so  is out of the question). There is no text or voice chat.  Singing is the only way to communicate, and the only control the player has over the note that’s played is the volume and duration.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshe_Chung#Target_of_griefing\">penis-themed griefing</a></p><p>Most critically, none of these actions can harm other players.  Even movement can’t be used as a weapon; players simply pass through each other, making it impossible to  or otherwise perturb their progress. Movement can’t even be used to race ahead and steal a desirable in-game item before another player can get to it, because power-ups are not consumed when acquired: they remain in place for future players to receive.<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-rl3RPC_Mw\">bump other players off a high ledge</a></p><p>All of this may sound like it stops just short of banning communication entirely.  Will players even bother to interact with each other?  Surely, such a limited palette of options will render the multiplayer aspects of Journey trite and inconsequential.</p><p>But that’s not what happens at all.  Instead, Journey players find themselves having some of the most meaningful and emotionally engaging multiplayer experiences of their lives.  How is this possible?</p><p>Though players can’t harm each other, they can  each other.  Touching another player recharges the power used to leap and (eventually) fly.  In cold weather, touching warms both players, fighting back the encroaching frost.  More experienced players can guide new players to secret areas and help them through difficult parts of the game.<i>help</i></p><p>Journey players are not better people than Call of Duty players or Halo players.  In fact, they’re often the same people.  The difference is in the design of the game itself.  By so thoroughly eliminating all forms of negative interaction, all that remains is the positive.</p><p>Players do want to interact; real people are much more interesting than computerized entities.  In Journey, players inevitably find themselves having positive interactions with others.  And, as it , many people find these positive, cooperative interactions even more rewarding than their usual adversarial gaming experiences.<a href=\"http://malcolmgladwellbookgenerator.com/\">turns out</a></p><p>Does this mean that playing Journey turns players into relaxed, peace-loving, spiritually enlightened beings?  Certainly not — but the limited communication system works in more ways than one.</p><p>In the same way that you can imagine the actors in a subtitled film (speaking in a language you don’t understand) are all giving Oscar-worthy performances, it’s natural to assume that every other Journey player has only the best intentions.  After all, while we may judge ourselves by our motivations, we tend to judge others by their actions.  The actions in Journey are all either neutral or positive, so that’s how players perceive each other.</p><p>Journey players are also anonymous during the game.  The unique player glyphs are only shown next to PlayStation Network account names when the game is over, and they change on each play-through.  Again, this plays into that subtitled-movie optimism.  It’s much easier to believe that the anonymous player with the winged glyph is the most caring, thoughtful person in the world when you don’t know his PSN account name is K1LLSh0t99.</p><p>If you want some evidence of the deep feelings triggered by this game, look no further than the  in the official forum for the game.  Here, players apologize to the anonymous others they feel they have disappointed in the game.  It’s like  for gamers.  Here’s an example post:<a href=\"http://www.thatgamecompany.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1897\">Journey Apologies thread</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missed_connection\">missed connections</a></p><p>Journey may be just a game, but the lessons it teaches about ourselves and the things we’re capable of creating can be applied to all of human endeavor.</p><p>Throughout history, we humans have invented many different sets of rules for ourselves.  Some have worked better than others, but all of them have been exploited.  As anyone with children knows, if there’s one thing humans are good at, it’s finding loopholes.</p><p>When a system of rules is applied to many people, thoroughly codified, and consistently enforced, you have something approaching a government.  But for governments, even the most successful change occurs slowly and often happens . This can lead even the most optimistic person to despair.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955%E2%80%931968)\">painfully</a></p><p>Human history is long, but how many different sets of rules have really been tried? In , it’s so difficult to establish a new set of rules or change the existing ones that the rate of design iteration is severely limited.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life#Related_terminology\">meatspace</a></p><p>This is not so in the relatively consequence-free worlds of video games and the Internet.  In the digital realm, wild experimentation and rapid iteration are the norm.  It’s also much easier to establish and enforce an iron-clad set of rules in a virtual world than in the real one.  This is the environment that created Journey, and its rarity is why it’s such a joy.</p><p>The lesson of Journey is that success is possible, even in an area like online multiplayer interaction which has seemed so hopeless for so long over so many thousands of iterations.  Success is possible.</p><p>But let’s go further.  Our digital lives increasingly affect our real lives.  Consider Twitter, another system for online interaction that has succeeded in large part thanks to its novel set of rules and limitations.  There’s a whole world of bad behavior that doesn’t fit into 140 characters and doesn’t work when producer/consumer relationships are asymmetrical.  Twitter isn’t just a game; its influence extends into the real world, in ways we don’t yet fully understand.</p><p>As another US presidential election season grinds on and I become freshly disillusioned with the seemingly intractable problems in our system of government, Journey and Twitter give me hope.  They make me believe that maybe, just maybe, the digital world can be both a laboratory for new ideas and, eventually, a giant lever with which to change the formerly unchangeable.</p><blockquote><p>To my friend in the fifth area: I never wanted to leave you. I just whiffed really badly on a jump. I miss you. And I’m sorry.</p></blockquote></div></div>",

      "link": "http://hypercritical.co/2012/07/25/mountain-lion",
      "content": "<p>As I have for the past 13 years (yikes!), I wrote a review of the latest major release of the Mac operating system, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2022/07/os-x-10-8/\">OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion</a>, for <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/\">Ars Technica</a>.  There are several ways to read it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2022/07/os-x-10-8/\">Read it for free on the web</a></li>\n\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008OYE8O8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008OYE8O8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=siracusa-20\">Buy the Kindle ebook for $4.99</a>\n\n<li> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/subscriptions/\">Subscribe to Ars Premier for a month for $5</a> and get <i>all</i> of these options:\n\n<ul>\n<li> Read it on a single, ad-free web page\n<li> Download an iBooks-compatible EPUB file\n<li> Download a PDF\n</ul>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are my thoughts on the various reading options.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"web-version\">The Web Version</h2>\n\n<p>I consider the web version to be the canonical version, and the version with the best formatting and the most features.  I believe that good writing for the web includes a lot of links.  A web browser is the best place to inspect and follow those links.</p>\n\n<p>The free web version has ads, and it’s split up into multiple “pages” (which are actually much longer than a single printed page).  This kind of pagination annoys some people.  I actually like it for very long articles because it helps me keep my place across multiple reading sessions.  I can remember I was on page 8 instead of remembering the exact point in a very long, scrolling web page.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I also really like how an <a href=\"ttp://arstechnica.com/subscriptions/\">Ars Premier subscription</a> eliminates all ads from the Ars Technica website and gives me the option to view any article on a single page.  I use single-page view on very long articles when I’m searching for some text using my web browser’s “Find…” feature.  I use it all the time on short articles.</p>\n\n<p>Some people think Ars Technica forces me to break my article up into many tiny pages.  That’s not the case.  I choose how to paginate the article.  I like to break it up on logical section boundaries, which means that the “pages” vary widely in length.  This year, Ars Technica actually asked me to merge several pages together to reduce the total number of pages (and I did).</p>\n\n<h2>The eBooks</h2>\n\n<p>This year, I created the Kindle and EPUB versions of the article myself.  They’re both generated from the canonical HTML version of the article.  Both ebook formats have severe limitations, most of which are imposed by the reader software.</p>\n\n<p>Reading the Kindle version using a device or application that supports <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000729511\">Kindle Format 8</a> provides the best experience of any of the ebook formats.  Kindle Format 8 readers support amazing new technologies such as text that flows around images and the ability to tie a caption to an image.  Yes, that was sarcasm.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately many Kindle reading devices and applications <i>don’t</i> support Kindle Format 8.  Most notably, the <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle-read-books-magazines/id302584613?mt=8\">iOS Kindle app</a> still does not support Kindle Format 8.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/kindleformac\">The Mac version</a> does, however, as does the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051VVOB2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0051VVOB2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=siracusa-20\">Kindle Fire</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Kindle ebook is a single file that contains two versions of the content: one in Kindle Format 8, and one in the older Kindle format.  Open the same ebook file in both the Mac and iOS Kindle reader applications and you’ll see two very different appearances.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s iBooks app displays the EPUB version of the book almost as well as the Kindle Format 8 readers, but it has an annoying habit of stretching the content to fit the vertical space of the page when a large image causes a mid-page break.  This can cause the image captions to be separate from their associated images by a big swath of whitespace.</p>\n\n<p>Lesser reader applications and devices display the Kindle and EPUB files in progressively more depressing ways. Most (all?) ebook reader applications also don’t provide a nice way to have a text link briefly display an image on top of the content, or to show a larger, un-cropped version of an inline image. I really wish ebook readers had the same capabilities and behaviors as a modern web browser.</p>\n\n<p>(I was not involved in the creation of the PDF version, but I imagine I’d find the limitations of the PDF format similarly frustrating.)</p>\n\n<h2>The Pricing</h2>\n\n<p>The Mountain Lion Kindle ebook is $4.99, which is the same as last year’s Lion ebook.  I considered a lower price, but Amazon’s ebook royalty system is definitely geared towards higher-priced (or maybe just smaller) ebooks.  Even at $4.99, more than half the purchase price is going to Amazon.  You can <a href=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/help?topicId=A29FL26OKE7R7B\">read Amazon’s pricing page</a> and do the math for yourself for a 7.5 MB Kindle ebook.</p>\n\n<p>At various times, people have asked me if I have <a href=\"https://flattr.com/profile/siracusa\">a flattr account</a> or something similar through which they can send me money.  It’s always felt weird to me for anyone to be sending me money “just because.”  I’m much more confortable creating something and then selling it to people who want it.  My Mountain Lion review provides just such an opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Last year was the first year that Ars Technica tried selling ebook versions of my writing.  <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/07/ars-technica-cashes-in-on-the-siracusa-brand-and-word-count-with-a-kindle-edition-of-his-review/\">The results</a> certainly exceeded my expectations, but I didn’t get any part of the ebook profits.  This year, I will.</p>\n\n<p>So if you’re one of those people who has asked about sending money to thank me for <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/author/john-siracusa/\">my writing</a>, <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/hypercritical\">my podcast</a>, or whatever, only to be rebuffed by my discomfort with receiving “<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAD6Obi7Cag\">money for nothing</a>,” now’s your chance to pay money for something: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008OYE8O8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008OYE8O8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=siracusa-20\">buy the Kindle ebook</a> or <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/subscriptions/\">subscribe to Ars Premier</a> for a month or a year.</p>\n\n<h2>The Stats</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li> 25,517 words.</li>\n<li> 167 images (31.6 MB)</li>\n<li> 371 original screenshots (252 MB)</li>\n<li> 10,339 words of research notes.</li>\n<li> 1,253 lines of Perl code across 10 scripts to generate three different formats from the canonical HTML source: Ars CMS, EPUB, and Kindle.\n<li> All three formats were generated 168 times (so far).\n<li> I saved the document 2,166 times while writing it in <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">BBEdit</a>.</li>\n<li> The article content was constantly backed up onto 6 different hard drives on three different Macs in two different locations (thanks to <a href=\"http://db.tt/KgXbHWr\">Dropbox</a>, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/14/#time-machine\">Time Machine</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/\">SuperDuper</a>), and pushed up to two different online backup services (<a href=\"http://www.backblaze.com/\">Backblaze</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crashplan.com/\">CrashPlan</a>).</li>\n<li> Applications used: <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">BBEdit</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nuance.com/for-individuals/by-product/dragon-for-mac/dragon-dictate/index.htm\">Dragon Dictate</a>, <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2523\">TextEdit</a>, <a href=\"http://simplenoteapp.com/\">Simplenote</a>, <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopextended.html\">Photoshop CS6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html\">VMware Fusion</a>, <a href=\"http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope/\">xScope</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/xcode/\">Xcode</a>, <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/\">Yojimbo</a>.\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Highlights from the Future</h2>\n\n<p>In an earlier post, <a href=\"http://siracusa.tumblr.com/post/15138872275/highlights-from-2011\">Highlights from 2011</a>, I worried that the audience for <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/author/john-siracusa/\">my brand of tech writing</a> was an ever-shrinking portion of a much larger, broader market.  I often feel the same way about my podcast, <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/hypercritical\">Hypercritical</a>—the third thing to share this name. (In order: <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/staff/2009/05/hypercritical/\">2009</a>, <a href=\"http://siracusa.tumblr.com/post/376341247/meta-tumblr\">2010</a>, <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/hypercritical\">2011</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>But the web traffic and ebook sales from last year’s Lion review showed me that, at the very least, my audience is still growing in absolute numbers even as it may be shrinking as a percentage of the whole.  For that, I continue to be very grateful, and I hope this year turns out just as well.  Thanks to all of my fellow nerds for allowing me to continue to do this.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I like pasta.  I’d like to help people make better pasta.  It pains me to think about all the poorly prepared pasta being served and eaten in America.  My advice will focus on plain old store-bought dried pasta.  Nothing fancy.  You’ve probably made some yourself.</p>\n\n<p>I’m specifically <i>not</i> talking about preparing or cooking fresh pasta, how to execute any particular pasta recipe, or why you should never, ever buy pasta sauce in a jar.  (You really shouldn’t, though.)  This is just about the basics: how to cook and serve dried pasta as part of some larger recipe, the details of which are out of scope, for now.\n\n<p>Here’s my advice, in no particular order.</p>\n\n<p><b>Do not overcook your pasta.</b></p>\n\n<p>Please, I beg you, do not overcook your pasta. Every time you serve a pile of starchy, gelatinous mush, an Italian grandmother sheds a single, silent tear.  Overcooking is <i>by far</i> the most common pasta sin in America.  (As evidence, consider that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Garden\">Olive Garden</a>, the gold standard for incorrectly prepared Italian food, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204466004577102464033301888.html\">intentionally overcooks its pasta</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>These days, the cooking times on most boxes of dried pasta are in the ballpark, but there are exceptions.  Boxed macaroni and cheese and other “children’s” pasta products routinely have cooking times that should be cut in <i>half</i>.  But even in the best case, cooking times are just estimates.  The actual cooking time will depend on the temperature and humidity of your kitchen, the mass and thermal conductivity of your cookware, the power of your cooktop, and on and on.</p>\n\n<p>As you gain experience, you’ll be able to tell when pasta is ready by “feel” (with a pair of tongs or a stirring spoon).  But the old fashioned way is still the most reliable: taste a piece.  Drop the pasta in the boiling water (see the next section for more on that), set a timer for 1-2 minutes <i>less than</i> the time on the box of your trusted dried pasta brand, and start tasting when it goes off.</p>\n\n<p>There’s an old saying about cooking eggs: done in the pan, overdone on the plate.  The same goes for pasta.  It will continue to cook after you remove it from the pot, and even more so when you put it directly into another hot pan or combine it with other hot, moist ingredients.</p>\n\n<p>Dried pasta in hot water cooks from the outside in.  The very last part to be cooked is the part that’s the least accessible to the hot water (e.g., the “knot” in the middle of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farfalle\">farfalle</a> bow tie).  Once the pasta is “cooked through,” meaning there’s no longer any trace of hard, dried pasta at the center, you’ve probably already waited too long to take it out of the water.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a good heuristic for string-shaped pasta like spaghetti.  Fold the pasta back on itself and pinch it near the end, forming a small loop where it makes a u-turn.  If that loops closes easily and completely collapses on itself, leaving no hole at all, you’ve waited too long to remove it from the water.</p>\n\n<p>One last tip on cooking times.  Pasta with a lot of surface area (e.g., <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotini\">rotini</a>) cooks faster, and it also <i>overcooks</i> faster.  It can take only a few seconds to go from “just right” to “too late.”  Be aware of your pasta shape.  The more surface area, the smaller the margin for error.</p>\n\n<p>I’m going to continue to my next point, but cooking time will come up again.  If you learn only one thing from reading this, it should be that doneness is the most complicated, difficult, and important aspect of cooking pasta.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cook your pasta in a sufficient amount of boiling, salted water.</b></p>\n\n<p>How much is a “sufficient” amount?  A good rule of thumb is 4-6 quarts of water for each pound of dried pasta. (Most boxes of dried pasta are 1 pound.)  You can <a href=\"http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/6162/what-is-the-correct-water-to-pasta-ratio\">probably get away with</a> using <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/dining/25curi.html?pagewanted=all\">less</a>, but I think that leads to a pot that feels too crowded.</p>\n\n<p>Fill your pot with cold water from the tap.  Hot water is more likely to pick up unpleasant stuff from the pipes.  Salt the water until it tastes like the ocean<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.  (If you don’t know what ocean water tastes like, please take a break now and find out.  This blog post will be here when you return.)  Nothing other than salt needs to be in the water.  Do not add oil.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve heard people say they add oil to the water to prevent the pasta from sticking to itself.  This is misguided on multiple levels.  First, the pasta will spend most of its time below the surface of the water, far from the oil which will all stay on the surface of the water.  Second, you want pasta’s natural, starchy surface to be exposed upon exiting the water so the pasta can absorb the flavorful ingredients you’re about to combine it with.  An oil coating would impair that.</p>\n\n<p>As with most kitchen myths, there is a kernel of truth behind the notion of oil in the pasta water:  pasta that sticks together is bad.  You do not want pasta to stick to other pieces of pasta, or to any part of the pot you’re boiling it in.  But the solution to this problem is simple: stir the pasta at a few key points during the cooking process.</p>\n\n<p>Stir right after you dump the pasta into the water.  Adding the pasta will decrease the temperature of the water, and may even take it off the boil.  This is fine, but it does mean that the bubbling action won’t be there to keep the pasta from settling to the bottom and sticking to itself or the hot surface of the pot.</p>\n\n<p>Stir again as the boil comes back, to confirm that the pieces really are all separate and not sticking to each other.  With any luck, the bubbles will keep everything moving and all the pieces of pasta separated for the rest of the cooking time.</p>\n\n<p> Long, stringy pasta shapes require the most stirring later in the cooking process because you can’t agitate them well until they become pliable, and at that point they may have been pressing up against their neighbor strands in hot water for a while.  Be vigilant.  If a few get away from you, tongs can help separate strands once the boil is rolling along again.</p>\n\n<p>(And please, do not break long, stringy pasta.  Cook and eat it at its natural length.  You’ll figure out the fork-twirling thing with a little practice.)</p>\n\n<p><b>Finish cooking your pasta in the sauce.</b></p>\n\n<p>Pasta should go directly from the hot water where it (mostly) cooked into a vessel where it will be combined with the rest of the ingredients in the finished dish.  It could be a traditional tomato sauce, olive oil with garlic, or a complicated multi-ingredient mixture.  Whatever it is, the pasta must <i>immediately</i> meet it.</p>\n\n<p>You should use a colander if it will take more than 15 seconds to fish out the pasta with tongs or other utensils.  Remember, it’s still cooking!  If you do use a colander, <i>do not rinse your pasta</i>.  Just think of the colander as a really large utensil for separating the pasta from the water and bringing it to its next vessel.</p>\n\n<p>When combining the pasta with the other ingredients, try to coat each and every piece of pasta.  If possible, undercook the pasta slightly (i.e., leave a tiny bit of uncooked dry pasta at the center) and really finish cooking it in the sauce.  This is most practical when combining a small amount of pasta with a sauce prepared in a very wide pan, preferably one that contains some liquid.  If liquid is lacking, a bit of the water that the pasta cooked in can be added.  (A splash of starchy pasta water is a common liquid thickener in many simple pasta recipes.)</p>\n\n<p><b>Sauce your pasta, but don’t over-sauce it.</b></p>\n\n<p>In case this doesn’t go without saying, if there’s a large volume of sauce, like a giant simmering pot of tomato sauce, don’t dump the pasta into it.  You will need some other pot or pan in which to mix the pasta and just the right amount of sauce.</p>\n\n<p>Once the hot water has been removed from it, the pot the pasta cooked in makes the perfect mixing vessel (and you won’t have to dirty another pot).  You may want to put a ladle full of sauce in the bottom of the pot before you dump the freshly drained pasta into it, lest a few pieces stick to the hot bottom.  Ladle in more sauce a bit at a time and mix until every piece of pasta is coated.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to be the inclination of Americans to put on too much sauce, so when in doubt, under-do it.  Sauce should touch every piece of pasta, but that doesn’t mean every piece should be covered with an opaque red coating.</p>\n\n<p>At the opposite end of the spectrum is the bowl of pale, virgin pasta with a giant mound of tomato sauce on top of it—a tasteless starch ball with a red hat.  This is almost as big a sin as overcooking (and is usually combined with it, naturally).</p>\n\n<p>Remember, sauce (or oil or whatever) must touch every piece.  You have to mix it in before serving.  Yes, even if you plan to provide more sauce on the side for people to add.  If you learn only two things from reading this, let the second be that you must never, ever serve a single piece of pasta that looks like it just came out of hot water and never touched another ingredient.</p>\n\n<p><b>Pasta should be served in warm bowls.</b></p>\n\n<p>If you plan to put the pasta in a large serving bowl, warm that bowl, and also warm all the individual bowls for each place setting.  The easiest way to warm bowls is to pour the hot pasta water into them.  If using a colander, line the bottom of your sink with bowls (stacking if necessary) and put the colander into one of them.  Then pour the pasta water into the bowls, ending by pouring the last of the water and the pasta itself into the colander.  If you have a fancy “warming drawer,” that works too.  But you’re going to have a bunch of hot water on hand anyway, so you might as well use it.</p>\n\n<p>This may all sound crazy—warm bowls? really?—but trust me, it makes a difference. Putting hot, freshly sauced pasta into a massive, cold, ceramic dish will instantly suck the life out of it.  Warm bowls.  Seriously.</p>\n\n<p><b>Serve and eat immediately.</b></p>\n\n<p>Baked pasta dishes are an exception; they almost always need to rest a while before serving.  But hot pasta mixed with sauce or other ingredients and not put into an oven must be served and eaten as soon as it’s ready.  This usually means that the pasta shouldn’t even be dropped into the hot water until everyone is in the process of coming to the table.  Some dishes can stand up to a few minutes on the table in a (warm) serving bowl, but the clock is ticking.</p>\n\n<p><b>Maintain perspective.</b></p>\n\n<p>If this all sounds pedantic and overwrought, well, it is.  But like anything else in cooking, it all becomes second nature if repeated enough times.  Just note your mistakes each time and try to do the opposite next time.</p>\n\n<p>I’m sure there are people reading this who have literally never undercooked pasta in their lives.  Try that next time.  See if you can intentionally undercook some pasta.  You may find it harder than you think.  Once you’ve done that, go back in the other direction.  Eventually, you’ll home in on “just right.”</p>\n\n<p>It’s often the case that the simpler the food, the more important the ingredients and the preparation techniques become.  This is true for eggs, and it’s definitely true for pasta.</p>\n\n<p>And speaking of ingredients, please do buy the best you can afford when making pasta dishes.  Dried pasta itself is incredibly inexpensive, and you shouldn’t be smothering it in sauce.  Spend your money on a little bit of good olive oil, fresh garlic, and real cheese.  Yes, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=parmigiano+reggiano\">parmigiano reggiano</a> is over $20 per pound these days, but a little goes a long way.  And when that freshly grated cheese hits the hot surface of that perfectly cooked pasta sitting in its warmed bowl, you’ll know it’s all been worth it.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><b>Bonus tip: pasta in soups.</b></p>\n\n<p>Many soup recipes include pasta: elbow macaroni, tiny stars, wide noodles, etc.  Pasta will overcook in soup just as easily as it will overcook in water.  To prevent this, cook the pasta ahead of time, undercooking it slightly.  After removing the pasta from the water, do something I just told you never to do: rinse the pasta in cold water to stop the cooking process, coat it in olive oil to prevent it from sticking to itself, then set it aside.</p>\n\n<p>When the time comes to serve the soup, add just the right amount of pasta to each individual bowl.  The (relatively) cool pasta will warm up quickly in the hot soup, and finish cooking through by the time the first bite is taken.  It will also help lower the temperature of the soup sightly, making it easier to eat with less blowing and potential tongue burning.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\"><p>Well, not really.

      "content": "<p>Here’s my brief entry in the speculation derby surrounding <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/technology/08apple.html\">the departure of Mark Papermaster from Apple</a>.  <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/08/07/papermaster\">Assuming</a> Papermaster is out at least partially due to the iPhone 4 antenna and not some completely unrelated matter, and <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2010/08/papermaster_damn_antenna\">assuming</a> Apple really did know about the iPhone 4’s antenna problems even before Papermaster was hired, it may seem strange or even unfair that he’s ended up as the fall guy.  I won’t comment on the fairness of the decision, but I can certainly imagine a scenario where his ouster is well within the expectations of a job as a high-level executive in a big corporation.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine the following events.  Papermaster is hired by Apple and put in charge of the iPhone 4 hardware.  He’s brought up to speed on the project, including the unique characteristics of the external antenna.  At some point later, a final decision has to be made on the design: go or no go?</p>\n\n<p>While it’s clear that the buck stops with Steve Jobs on all decisions at Apple, that doesn’t mean he <i>makes</i> all the decisions.  This is why Apple hires people like Mark Papermaster in the first place.  It’s reasonable to expect that Jobs would defer to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/technology/04iht-apple.4.17516602.html\">the guy he fought to hire</a> when it came to this question.  And so Jobs would ask Papermaster, is the design ready to go or not?  And what about that antenna touching issue?  Is that a big deal, or will most people not even notice?</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine that Papermaster tells Jobs that, yes, it’s a real limitation in the antenna design, but that the advantages&mdash;increased range and room for a bigger battery&mdash;more than make up for it.  Now imagine Jobs pushes further: “While you may feel that way, Mark, will the public agree?  Will this end up being an issue?”  And now suppose Papermaster says no, it won’t be an issue.</p>\n\n<p>Either implicitly or explicitly, Papermaster would be putting his reputation on the line.  This is what his job is all about: making decisions.  This particular decision is not about technology or manufacturing; it’s a judgement call about how the public (and press) will react to something.  But that’s part of his job too.  And the harder he fought for this particular decision, the more he’d have on the line when he turned out to be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, like I said, this is all just speculation.  I really have no idea why Mark Papermaster left Apple.  But I find the scenario described above eminently plausible.  Furthermore, if it were true, I don’t think it would speak ill of Papermaster.  Executive management at this level is a high-stakes endeavor.  The rewards are big, but so are the risks&mdash;and no one can be right <a href=\"http://www.mac-history.net/the-history-of-the-apple-macintosh/showdown-at-apple-john-sculley-vs-steve-jobs\">all</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G4_cube\">the time</a>.  If you’re the new guy and this is your first big call on the biggest project in the company, well, you can end up back in the job market much sooner than you expected. C’est la vie.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Many years ago, I recall talking with some of my Mac-nerd friends about how strange it was, after Apple’s near-death experiences of the late 1990s, to be living in a world where it’s just assumed that any tech luminary will mostly likely use a Mac.  A year or two later, Tim O’Reilly gave a name to this prognostication technique: <a href=\"http://oreilly.com/pub/a/mac/2002/05/14/oreilly_wwdc_keynote.html\">watching the “alpha geeks.”</a></p>\n\n<p>This trend of Mac adoption among alpha geeks was a sign of good things to come for Apple, and generally a bad sign for its competitors.  Today, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling\">James Gosling</a>’s <a href=\"http://nighthacks.com/roller/jag/entry/time_to_move_on\">departure</a> from the remains of Sun brought to mind a similar trend&mdash;one that’s not so good for Apple.</p>\n\n<p>These days, when a high-profile technical professional leaves his position at the company where he’s done his most important work, everyone’s first guess as to where he’ll end up is&hellip;well, do I really have to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/\">name the place</a>?  The point is, it’s not Apple.</p>\n\n<p>(This mostly applies to programmers and other engineers.  People on the more creative side of the technology world are <a href=\"http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/and-now-opera\">much harder to predict</a>.  But then, who can <a href=\"http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/moving-on\">truly fathom</a> the mind of an artist?)</p>\n\n<p>There are many trend lines that contribute to a company’s overall trajectory, and nearly all of Apple’s are still <a href=\"http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1270998157208&amp;chddm=97750&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=NASDAQ:AAPL&amp;ntsp=0\">pointing in the right direction</a>.  But the emergence of Google as a huge gravitational sink for engineering talent in the past five years has definitely put a kink in at least one those graphs.</p>",

I knew this when I added it to my Netflix queue, but I wanted to stay up to date on the latest in computer-generated apocalyptic destruction.  I’m a fan of special effects in general and stories about the end of the world in particular.</p>\n\n<p>All the boxes were ticked: absurd “science,” impossible escapes, a nonsensical plan to save humanity, familial and romantic problems resolved during the crisis, unintentionally slapstick character deaths, etc.  What I didn’t expect was how upsetting it would be&mdash;which is to say, that it was upsetting <i>at all</i>.</p>\n\n<p>The most heartless, lizard-brained humans are pre-teen boys.  Teens and young adult men have usually built up a tough emotional core, but are generally too distracted by puberty to ever match the hardness of their unenlightened, toad-exploding youths.  As men age, they become progressively more sensitive.  The biggest spike (or dip?) in the graph occurs when a man becomes a father.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, this manifests itself most noticeably in a reduced ability to enjoy any story where children are in peril.  And so it was for me with 2012.  As bad as the movie was, I was still bothered by the repeated use of children in danger as a dramatic device.  This, despite the fact that there is never any mystery about who will live and who will die in any given scene.  My brain understood, but my body still twinged.</p>\n\n<p>So let this be a lesson to you, young men.  You may feel tough now, and you may remain rational and intelligent your entire lives.  But you will age, and someday you may even become a father.  When you do, watch out.  You too&mdash;yes, even you, you, and <i>you</i>&mdash;will someday become an unintentional victim of your own emotions.  (A “mush,” as I’ve heard it called.)</p>\n\n<h3>It’s Not You, It’s Me</h3>\n\n<p>I always ponder this situation when I see a movie or read a book.  It seems to me that our ability to enjoy a story depends on our personal experiences to a degree that people don’t want to consider.  For example, a common occurrence on this Internet of ours is to encounter an impassioned screed condemning some work of fiction as offensive.  Like clockwork, this is followed by a retaliatory condemnation of the offended party as “too sensitive” or “crazy.”  The phrase “give me a break” is featured.</p>\n\n<p>The overall point that the inherent worth of a work of art is not determined by the bad reactions of a few people is pretty solid.  But the glib denigration of the offended party is definitely on shaky ground.  The unfortunate truth is that, through no fault of the artist or the viewer, entire avenues of entertainment can be closed off by life experiences.</p>\n\n<p>If your wife died in a car accident, you may find yourself unable to enjoy movies that feature car crashes.  If you had an abusive parent, you may be upset by any scene where a parent yells at a child.  And yes, if you simply have one or more happy, healthy children, you may not even be able to smirk your way through a comically bad disaster movie which happens to feature children.</p>\n\n<p>None of this has to reach the level of trauma (e.g., a veteran being unable to watch war movies).  In fact, it’s most insidious when it’s much less dramatic, just a mild pin-prick of discomfort happening entirely outside&mdash;and often in opposition to&mdash;your conscious mind.</p>\n\n<p>And is this the fault of the artist?  Is the comedy <i>actually</i> less funny because there’s a gag involving turbulence on an airplane?  And on the other side, can you really blame the viewer?  I say no on all counts, as long as everyone involved has a clear head about the situation.  For the viewer, that means no blanket denunciation of a work of art based solely on your own unexamined emotional reaction.  For the artist, that means understanding that some people will be legitimately upset by your creation for reasons beyond your ability to predict or control.</p>\n\n<p>So yeah, thumbs down on 2012, but not because I’m a father of two and a giant mush.  It’s bad for all the usual reasons a movie is bad: script, story, characters, etc.  Maybe if you don’t have kids, you can appreciate it as a <a href=\"http://www.flophousepodcast.com/\">\"good ‘bad movie.’\"</a>  Maybe.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, lest you young men get depressed about your inevitable futures as wussy old(er) men, there is actually an upside.  A <i>good</i> movie that happens to intersect with your newly altered emotional landscape can be made all the more better by the interaction.  For example, I enjoyed reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307387895?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=siracusa-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307387895\">The Road</a>, which is a much more intense story of the apocalypse and a child in danger than 2012.  Here’s hoping <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB563E?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=siracusa-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001FB563E%22\">the movie adaptation</a> doesn’t suck.</p>",

Whatever the reason, my low opinion of his speaking ability meant that I was willing to believe that the  could very well be indicative of a real problem.  Those jokes fed my fear that Obama lacked substance, that he was just a pretty voice able to dazzle people (though not me, apparently) with speeches he didn’t write or fully understand.<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19663.html\">Obama teleprompter gibes</a></p><p>That fear was put to rest by Obama’s .  No teleprompter, no questions received ahead of time, no softballs.  I was amazed at how well he did when I read the transcript.

Case in point? <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX532LL-A-AirTag/dp/B0CWXNS552\">Amazon</a> is no longer selling a single AirTag, and it’s unclear when — or if — the retailer will restock the first-gen model. Thankfully, you can still grab a four-pack of the first-gen location trackers for around $64 ($35 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542LL-A-AirTag-Pack/dp/B0D54JZTHY\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirTag-4-Pack/5395277557\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/product/apple-airtag-4-pack-1st-generation-2021-silver/JJGCQ8XFQH/sku/6461349\">Best Buy</a> for Presidents Day, which is $2 shy of the bundle’s best price to date. If you just want one, you can also buy a single tracker at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirTag-1-Pack/5396499207\">Walmart</a> for $17 ($12 off).</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Apple AirTag (first-gen)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461387/vpavic_4547_20210421_0074.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"AirTagsA\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542LL-A-AirTag-Pack/dp/B0D54JZTHY\"> <strike>$99</strike> $64 at <strong>Amazon (four-pack)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirTag-4-Pack/5395277557\"> <strike>$99</strike> $64 at <strong>Walmart (four-pack) </strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/product/apple-airtag-4-pack-silver/JJGCQ8XFQH/sku/6461349\"> <strike>$99</strike> $64.99 at <strong>Best Buy (four-pack)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re an iPhone owner, you’d be hard-pressed to find another tracker that’s as precise or as helpful as Apple’s AirTag. That’s because, like the second-gen model, the original can tap into Apple’s vast Find My network and leverage ultra wideband (UWB) technology. As a result, all you need to do is open up the Find My app on your phone and follow the on-screen arrows, sounds, or vibrations, which will guide you to the exact location of your item, even if it’s slipped between your car seats. That’s a level of precision many rival trackers, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tile-Life360-Pro-Bluetooth-Compatible/dp/B0D637HWC5/\">notably Tile’s</a>, lack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On top of that, you also get access to a growing list of helpful software features. You can, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/6/23751614/apple-airtag-find-my-sharing-ios-17-feature\">share an AirTag’s location with up to five people</a> — which comes in handy for families while traveling — and you can even temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293654/apple-ios-18-2-share-airtag-locations\">share an AirTag’s location </a>with some airlines (including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/616912/american-airlines-apple-airtag-share-item-location-lost-luggage\">American Airlines</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/607690/lufthansa-virgin-atlantic-apple-airtag-share-item-location\">Virgin Atlantic</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to the aforementioned software perks, Apple’s handy location trackers are designed to last. The battery can last up to a year, and when it dies, you just need to swap in a standard CR2032 cell instead of replacing the tracker entirely. Each AirTag also carries an IP67 rating, meaning it can withstand both dust and a little bit of rain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are some features you’ll miss out on if you go with the last-gen AirTag instead of the newer model, including an upgraded UWB chip that enables more precise location tracking. The second-gen version can also help you track items further away, and the speaker is 50 percent louder. But if you want to save some cash, the original is still one of the better trackers on the market and definitely worth picking up while you still can.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety\">Read our full AirTag (2021) review</a>.</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

It can save you time and money, too, compared to buying PC components piecemeal. If you’re weighing your options, consider some Presidents Day offers on iBuyPower’s pre-built desktops, including the <strong><a href=\"https://www.ibuypower.com/store/rdy-element-9-pro-r07\">$1,899 RDY Element 9 Pro R07</a></strong> and the <strong><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/product/ibuypower-slate-gaming-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-amd-radeon-rx-9070xt-16gb-32gb-ddr5-rgb2tb-nvme-ssd-black/J3R75JYGZ5\">$2,099.99 Slate</a></strong> — both of which are stocked with high-end AMD processors and GPUs that can tear through most games at 1440p with fast frame rates. They also come with 32GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of storage, along with a mouse and keyboard.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Digging into the Element 9 Pro R07, it features AMD’s Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor, a Radeon 9070 XT graphics card with 16GB of VRAM (roughly on-par with the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti), 32GB of DDR6 6000MHz RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD built into the Asus B650EM Max Gaming motherboard. It ships in iBuyPower’s Element 9 Pro case, which has tempered glass on the front and one side, and features a 360mm RGB liquid cooling system. The system includes an 850W power supply, a wired mouse, and a keyboard, plus a three-year labor warranty and two years of parts coverage. The GPU will be shipped uninstalled, so that’s the only component you’ll need to insert with iBuyPower’s <a href=\"https://content.ibuypower.com/Download/GPU-Manual.pdf\">instructions</a>. Normally $2,149, you can currently get it for $1,899 at <a href=\"https://www.ibuypower.com/store/rdy-element-9-pro-r07\">iBuyPower</a> when you use coupon code <strong>STARS </strong>at checkout.</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>iBuyPower Element 9 Pro R07 gaming desktop</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/r07.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.ibuypower.com/store/rdy-element-9-pro-r07\"> <strike>$2349</strike> $1899 at <strong>iBuyPower (with code STARS)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Slate has slightly different specs, some that are improved over the Element above and some that are a bit below what it provides. The biggest highlight is that the Slate features AMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, which edges out the 7800X3D in performance (although both are very capable CPUs). It also features an AMD Radeon 9070 XT graphics card, 32GB of DDR5 RAM at 5,200MHz instead of 6,000MHz, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. Like the R07, it includes a wired keyboard and mouse to get you started, along with a 750W power supply, a liquid cooling system, and a one-year warranty.
